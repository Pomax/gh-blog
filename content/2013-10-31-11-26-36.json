{"title":"","author":"","content":"#First post!\nThis is a gh-pages blog that uses github.js to effect repo changes whenever you post, edit, or remove entries.\n\n# Authentication\nThere's an authentication \"link\" at the top (it currently looks like a dotted circle) that you can click and then input your github application token. These tokesn are tied to your own repo, so while you'll see the \"admin\" buttons if you authenticate with a wrong key, the actual updates to github will get rejected.\n\n# Rebuilding the gh-page site\nAnother interesting thing is that because gh-pages don't instantly rebuild, you can't immediately link someone to the page after you posted an entry. Think of it as a cool-down period (or a bug. Either works, but a cool-down period is nicer).\n\n# Manual updates\nIt's just a code repo, so you can do as much manual work as you like by just doing a **git pull**, editing/removing/whathaveyou to your heart's content, and then pushing that up to the gh-pages branch. It's just code.","published":1383243996314,"updated":1383245065706}
