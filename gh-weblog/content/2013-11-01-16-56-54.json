{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#What am I looking at?\nThis is a web log that's running through github's \"you make a branch called gh-pages and we'll host it on yourname.github.io/reponame\" concept. Each entry is just a code commit (a .json file, to be exact), and is loaded from github into this page. Since entries are just code, when you write a new entry, or edit an existing entry, or delete an entry you no longer want to be public, this page uses the JavaScript GitHub API to simply effect those changes in your github repo. It's like gh-pages INSIDE gh-pages. Sort of. Anyway the point is that you don't need anything other than github to make this work. No LAMP stack, or CMS install, just a github account and a gh-pages branch. Done. Weirdly enough, this did not exist yet... and I has some spare time so I wrote it myself.","published":1383350214096,"updated":1383351331448}
