# Chinese Classical scoring script

In order to play the Chinese Classical variant of mahjong without having to constantly figure out the score at the end of each round, I wrote an <a href="/downloads/mjscoring" target="_blank">online script-based scoring page</a>, which allows us to mark sets as they are made, significantly speeding up the game. You may use this script for free for the while in case it helps you, although if you find it does make your game more fun because you're doing less math and more winning, feel free to make a <a href="http://www.nihongoresources.com/general/donate ^.^.html" target="_blank">donation to nihongoresources</a> ^_^
