# XeTex and Texmaker

<a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/" target="_blank">Texmaker</a> is a fantastic program for writing TeX if you know what you are doing (which, if you decided to start using TeX instead of the annoyances that are Office - be they Open or MS - you finally should). However, for people like me, the only TeX version that makes any sense is <a href="http://www.tug.org/xetex/" target="_blank">XeTeX</a>, and more specifically XeLaTeX, which is XeTeX with the LaTeX macros added into it.

Why XeTeX? Well, unlike the 1980s, it was designed specifically to work with unicode text, and files in UTF8 encoding. Secondly, it also has "fontspec" available, which means you don't have to try to bend over backwards to make font definitions for TeX. Just use your system fonts like you would in an Office application.

The only problem is that XeTeX is of course the 'spec'. It tells you how you can write your files, and then leaves you to pick whatever editor you like best. You should like Texmaker, because it's specifically designed to a) let you very comfortably write LaTeX in all its glory, and b) it actually works with unicode and files in UTF8.

So how to set it up:

step 1: install <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/" target="_blank">TexLive</a> or <a href="http://miktex.org/" target="_blank">MikTeX</a> (your call, both easy, I went with the latter), and then install Texmaker. 

step 2: In Texmaker, go to options -> configure texmaker, and click on the 'editor' options.

ã€€ã€€ã€€editor font encoding -> utf-8 

step 3: in the quick build, use the following:

ã€€ã€€ã€€xelatex %.tex|"yourPDFreaderProgramExecutable" %.pdf 

so for me that looks like:

ã€€ã€€ã€€xelatex %.tex|"C:\Program Files\Foxit Reader\Foxit Reader.exe" %.pdf

step 4: in the command section, replace "latex" with "xelatex"

okay you're done. Since Xe(La)TeX automatically generates PDF files. none of that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format" target="_blank">DVI</a> shite (Pomax doesn't like DVI files) so you might want to install a nice pdf reader. Like <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php" target="_blank">Foxit Reader</a>
