# Sparrow hawk(s)

Last May a sparrow hawk decided to hawk away in our garden block, in the middle of the city (Rotterdam). We managed to get pretty close to it, so my mom and I decided to take a few pictures of it. Lots of duplicates, but after some selection-making I ended up putting five of them online, starting at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pomax/2892614364/" target="_blank">this</a> picture. The fifth picture has moderate safety set, because it shows the sparrow hawk eating the sparrow (gasp! nature! too horrible!)
