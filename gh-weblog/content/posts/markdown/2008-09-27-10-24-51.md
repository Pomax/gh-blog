# RSS feeds

In a final bit of homepage-code-updating I added an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)" target="_blank">RSS</a> 2.0 feed to this setup. When you load the page, most modern browsers will indicate it has an RSS feed available for it, which points to <a href="http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/rssfeed.php" target="_blank">http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/rssfeed.php</a>. This page will generate guid-tagged RSS 2.0 content based on the entries that have been posted to the website, which means that your RSS reader/aggregator can detect which entries you already saw, and which are new.

Not that I expect a crazy amount of traffic on my site, or a crazy amount of posting going on that warrants RSS feeding, but it's always nice to add in modern technologies, especially ones that are really easy to implement.
