# Berlin botanical garden

Finally reached "July" in my "still to process" pile of (digital) photographs, which means I have now processed and uploaded the photographs from my Berlin trip, covering the <a href="http://www.bgbm.org/BGBM/museum/museum-e.htm" target="_blank">Berlin Botanical Gardens</a>. Of course, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pomax/sets/72157601598491966/" target="_blank">Artis de Partis</a> went with.
