# The Alte Nationalgalerie

One of the musea we went to on our Berlin trip was the <a href="http://www.smb.spk-berlin.de/smb/sammlungen/details.php?lang=en&objectId=17" target="_blanket">Alte Nationalgalerie</a>, or 'old' national gallery. The only reason it's called that is because they built a newer one for even more art, but until that gets reopened (aye, newer and under construction already!) <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pomax/sets/72157607662963754/" target="_blank">here</a> are the pictures we took at the old one.
