# Escape your strings...

Never send data with a javascript POST call without rewriting your string... most specifically, use this:

```
var data = document.getElementById('someid').value;
data = data.replace("%","%25");
data = data.replace("&","%26");
```

This gave me headaches for quite a while, and blaming half a dozen things that had absolutely nothing to do with it >.>
