# The Altes Museum

I'd love to say the Altes Museum is well worth visiting, and then back it up with hundreds of photographs, but I only have two to show you. A <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pomax/2907068295/" target="_blank">goat</a>, and a long, long <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pomax/2907069437/" target="_blank">dead guy</a>. The rest just weren't good enough to bother sticking on Flickr (yes, I actually do selective posting. You don't get to see all the bad pictures I make. Obviously)
