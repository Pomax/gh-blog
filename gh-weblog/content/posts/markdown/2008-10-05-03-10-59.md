# The web and UTF8...

Getting all the web tech and unicode text to play nice together is a chore. It really is. So, thanks to <a href="http://www.dangrossman.info/2007/05/25/handling-utf-8-in-javascript-php-and-non-utf8-databases/" target="_blank">Dan Grossman</a> the following should always be observed:
<ul>
  <li>use encodeURIComponent() on any bit of text you are sending through a javascript call to a webpage (what people like to call AJAX, even though it's not always A, and half the time not even AX). <emph>don't use escape()</emph>.</li>
  <li>if you're calling a php script, first call urldecode() <emph>if it was a POST request</emph>. If it wasn't, <emph>don't</emph>, PHP will have decoded the content already and explicitly calling it again may screw up your data</li>
</ul>

Fun stuf... -_-

Also, just because that's something I personally care about, I added a bit of source formatting (yes, the css tagging can be tightened. Later chore).
