# 10,000 hits a day O_O!

Well, this is something novel.

I started out Nihongoresources I was getting 300 hits a week, and that was awesome. Then it became 3000 a week, and that was pretty impressive. Then I reached 100,000 a month and I was duly impressed but now it's getting slightly insane. Nihongoresources just past the "10,000 page requests a day" mark!

A DAY! O_O!!

No, I don't make any kind of money off of it (donations go to the site, buying japanese dictionaries, books, etc, paying for hosting). Wish I was but then I'd need to turn it into a business model somehow and I don't know if I can (or want to) do so without destroying its "it's free" aspect.

We'll see how well the new kanji ordering approach will work out, and the book revision.

Damn, 10,000 hits a day (and proper hits, not just page hits but unique page requests)

Just... you monster.
