# I like garfield, but I hate flash...

So in the interest of my own sanity, and in case anyone else benefits from actually having the direct archive link:

http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/[yyyy]/ga[yymmdd].gif

where yyyy is obviously the four digit year code, and yy, mm and dd are the two digit year, month and date code.

I hate websites that wrap their content in flash, just so they can wrap their content in flash -_-
