# CSS2, ruby markup, and Gecko... hell

Until <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> 3.0 showed up (or more accurately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_(layout_engine)" target="_blank">Gecko</a> 1.9), Gecko had its own flavour of "inline-table" <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/" target="_blank">CSS2</a> elements. That was annoying, but using "inline" and relying on graceful degradation meant that using CSS2 to render <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/" target="_blank">ruby annotation</a> (which has made its way into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/" target="_blank">draft for HTML5</a>, finally), <ruby><rb>which</rb><rt>1</rt></ruby> <ruby><rb>looks</rb><rt>2</rt></ruby> <ruby><rb>like</rb><rt>3</rt></ruby> <ruby><rb>this</rb><rt>4</rt></ruby>.

With Gecko 1.9, all that broke. Gecko now <i>does</i> support the "inline-table" rule, but that doesn't mean it renders it the way it used to render the "inline" rule. The result? I have to use multiple CSS files now, with IE hack html, just to get ruby to look the way it's supposed to across IE 5  and anything running gecko 1.9.

And the people who still use Firefox 2?

I have no idea, honestly. Basically, Gecko 1.8- was doing the rendering wrong, and 1.9 actually does it right, and I'm afriad that everyone on Firefox 2 or 1.5 will simply not be able to enjoy ruby anymore =(

ã€€"Oh now, Mike, that can't possibly be a lot of people anymore?"

Nihongoresources browser report for October so far:

1) 23241 requests by Firefox (18046 FF3, 5099 FF2, 96 FF1)
2) 13630 requests by IE (9321 IE7, 4162 IE6, 92 IE8, 53IE5, 2 IE4)

Yeah, those IE 4/5 and Firefox 1 make me wonder 'wth?' too, but there are still more Firefox 2 users than there are IE6 users. That should tell you something.

Sometimes the web just doesn't want to play nice T_T
