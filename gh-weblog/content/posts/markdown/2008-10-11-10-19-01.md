# Pomax <3 Ideographic Description Characters

Last time I made the "blue file", a file describing which kanji is decomposed (visually) in what way, I did not have the knowledge that I do now:

There is an Ideographic Description Characters block in the unicode 5.0 planes, which means that describing kanji has become a lot less problematic!

What are they? Well, if your font supports it, they look like this: â¿°, â¿±, â¿², â¿³, â¿´, â¿µ, â¿¶, â¿·, â¿¸, â¿¹, â¿º and â¿». These can then be used to describe kanji fairly easily. Say I want to describe å¯º, I could write â¿±åœŸå¯¸ and Bob's my uncle - the description is complete.

This is great! Except of course for one thing: overlapping kanji. How do you describe ä¸¸? That's what â¿» is for, which indicates an overlap of components: â¿»ä¹ãƒ½ works, although that doesn't quite tell you where the overlap is, so I use â¿»â¿±ä¹ãƒ½ to indicate there is an overlap, and broadly it can be considered a vertical split with "nothing" and "a tick mark". This is not ideal, but certainly better than using brackets and parentheses.

That only leaves my woe that there is no "commonly used ideographs" block, that simply contains all the graphemes used in kanji/hanzi. It gets really annoying having to describe è‰® without that â€² at the bottom right.
