# Getting the codepoint for a unicode character

Ever had to convert UTF16 to hex? If you're like me, then yes, frequently. If you're not like me, then you probably have no idea this was something someone might even want to do =)

Personally, I frequently need to know the unicode codepoint for a character because I "sort of know" where some character I am looking for will be in the unicode map, and I Babelmap doesn't let you find a glyph based on... err, that glyph. You need to know its codepoint.

A tad inconvenient, and no, the internet seems to have NO CONVERTERS AT ALL. I find this bizar, but then I find more things bizar (like starbucks selling coffee that has been burnt, not roasted, and no one complaining about this). So, in the good spirit of "I wouldn't be a paid software engineer if I couldn't write a bit of javascript that did this for me".

Turns out I can, with the help from the <a href="http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#35" target="_blank">unicode FAQ</a>, and the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt" target="_blank">charCodeAt</a> javascript <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp" target="_blank">string</a> function. It was a bit frustrating getting the wrong value back, until I found the mozilla page explaining that charCodeAt has to be called on two positions rather than one for high UTF16 codes... problem solved!
