# What they don't teach you about 64 bit

I got a new laptop, courtesy of "The Company".

I will probably give it back to them, because I hate it: it has no dedicated home/end buttons (Fn left/right? wtf?), there are no empty keys above the left/right cursor so forget about finding the cursor block without looking at it, the parts of the casing that my palms rest on heat up, making using it actually painful; there is a switch for the wifi, but not one for bluetooth. Oh yes, and lest I forget:

SHINY SUPER REFLECTIVE 15.4" WIDESCREEN MONITOR AT 1900x1200

What the hell were the thinking? I run my own 17" widescreen laptop on 1440x900, because that's comfortable to human eyes. cramming more pixels in less surface is not progress, and probably funded by the American Association of Opticiens.

But the worst part is that reflection. A very shiny monitor, of which the surface is not perfectly smooth, means you see every vibration because while the desktop doesn't shake, the light reflected on the surface of the screen does. This is a problem you simply don't have with "cheaper" monitors. Who thought this was a good idea for laptops that people have to work with, rather than have to show off? Never mind what the person next to me can see on my screen, *I* can't see what I'm doing under normal office lighing conditions... we have these things in our walls called windows, LIGHT COMES IN!

...but of course, that is not the issue of this post, really. The issue is that this laptop had the technical specs to make one go "tasty!". It has 4 gigs of RAM and a Core 2 Duo T9300, which is a bit of a beast, and also a nicely 64 bit processor. The laptop itself is a DELL Vostro 1510, and because it's a DELL it didn't come preloaded with a 64 bit OS, because DELL hasn't done 64 bit operating systems for over a year now.

This struck me as odd. A 32 bit OS will not be able to access all of the 4GB ram it is outfitted with, so what were they thinking? Why this theoretical monster without an operating system to properly make use of it?

After half a day of installing Windows Server 2008 x64 on it, I now have my own reasons for severely disliking the 64 bit versions of Windows that DELL decided not to carry anymore...

<u>Reason 1) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Patch_Protection" target="_blank">PatchGuard</a></u>

Windows XP 64 as of SP2, Windows Vista x64 and Windows Server 2008 x64 apparently come with what is the most annoying kernel level feature yet: a system that monitors the running kernel to make sure nothing hooked into it.

I don't know about you, but I sandbox applications on a more than once a day basis. And not my web browser (I blame Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a> for making people now commonly believe 'sandboxing' - and no, it't not a legal verb - means running your browser in a throw-away environment), but genuine applications that have the nasty habit of placing files where I don't want them, modifying my registry invisibly, and generally being a nuisance to uninstall properly.

<a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/" target="_blank">Sandboxie</a> is a blessing - it also doesn't work under x64 Windows because Microsoft became paranoid about kernel hooks.

<u>Reason 2) I am a java developer.</u>

This means I either use <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">Netbeans</a>, or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>. Or a text editor if I just need a quick test class, but not using netbeans, I spend 99.9% of my java time in Eclipse.

Eclipse does not like x64 at all... I can install the 64 bit version of java as much as I like, and eclipse will still require an experimental build to function properly.

<u>Reason 3) Forced Driver Signing</u>

Want to install a freeware bit of software that had the sense to not pay Microsoft thousands of dollars to have their driver digitally signed? Welcome to hell.

You used to be able to turn that off, thanks to the marvel that is <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709667.aspx" target="_blank">bcdedit</a>, but no, they had to go and remove that the same time they invented PatchGuard. If the drivers are unsigned, unpleasant things ensue.

All in, it's too much of a lockdown to be able to enjoy, so I'll spend the *rest* of today installing Windows Server 2008, the 32 bit version.

  <span style="font-style: italic">"But Mike! Why not install [insert Linux version here]?"</span>

Do I seem the kind of person who wants to learn how to configure a new OS from scratch to my liking on a monday? (If you answered yes, I've been giving off entirely the wrong impression >.>)
