# Some more RSS feeds

I added an RSS link for tracking comments to a particular post. This solves my problem of having to make the server send out emails left and right whenever someone comments, and your problem that I would have to have your email address in order to do that.

With the current system, once you post a comment a link will come into existence right under the "Comments for this post" line, on the top right, at the start of the comments. This link points to a script that generates an RSS 2.0 feed for a particular post's comments, so with modern browsers all you have to do is click on it, and hit "Subscribe".

Whenever someone posts an additional comment, you'll be notified through your browser's RSS feed monitor ^_^

Okay that's it for me today, time to go do something not computer related...
