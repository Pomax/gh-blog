# I moved

An update for those wondering where stuff is: I just sort-of-finished moving over a four day period. The four day period I have off from work. In between moving and unboxing everything, I did a little bit of programming (I wrote a properly unicode aware charactger array and matching unicode string for java, because java hasn't supported unicode since 2006).

The low down: I'm going to watch the US elections tonight. Which means I'm taking tomorrow off on account of "I've not slept yet", and then I'll be at work thursday and friday - expect anything not before the coming weekend.

I'm out! (literally. moving stuff is tiring)
