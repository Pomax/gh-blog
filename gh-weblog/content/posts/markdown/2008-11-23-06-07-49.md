# And of the holiday

And so finally I've worked my way through my backlog of photographs. The last set covers, in a whopping nine photographs, our entire <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax/sets/72157609827566374/" target="_blank">10 days in London</a>.

Less than one photograph a day on average worth putting online, and of those, at least one grudgingly... I guess the saddest part of that is that I'm likely never to, at least on a whim, drop by London again as the friend I would usually visit has now moved to a small island off the coast of France.

Another chapter closed.
