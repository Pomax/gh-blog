# Canada and a family outing

I went over to Canada for christmas, staying for a month, when it decided to snow unseasonably much. The result was a few nice pictures that I've put up in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pomax/sets/72157612813748366/" target="_blank">a set</a> on Flickr, followed by the photos I thought were worth keeping of my grandmother's birthday celebration at a cooking workshop/school type venue right after I got back, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/pomax/sets/72157612728260229/" target="_blank">here</a>
