# Java doesn't understand the concept of 'virtual key'

For your enjoyment I offer the following <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4262044" target="_blank">bug report</a> on the sun bugtracker for java. 

The short of it: you can't rely on java's VK_xxxx keymappings. Even though the whole reason those codes exist is so you don't have to match on character.

Goddamnit, sun.
