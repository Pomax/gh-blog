# PHP5 and SQLite3

Some people like being able to use <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite</a> databases in PHP. That's great, except PHP only supports sqlite2.x databases, which haven't been supported by the "latest" SQLite for years now. The standard is SQLite3, has been for a while, and there's no native support a la the sqlite_open functions in PHP5.ã€€But fret not - while the documentation for SQLite3 on <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">php.net</a> is <a href="http://nl.php.net/manual/en/intro.sqlite3.php" target="_blank"><b>USELESS</b></a>, the simple solution is to use <a href="http://nl.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php" target="_blank">PDO</a> instead of using a dedicated SQLite object. PHP can talk to SQLite3 just fine, someone just needs to update the bloody documentation for it:

$dbh = new PDO('sqlite:yourdatabase.db');<br/>foreach($dbh->query('SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = criterium') as $row)<br/>{<br/>ã€€foreach($row as $key=>$val)<br/>ã€€{<br/>ã€€ã€€// there is a way to make PDO return as associative array,<br/>ã€€ã€€// I just didn't bother looking up how.<br/>ã€€ã€€if(!is_numeric($key)) echo "$key: $val\n";<br/>ã€€}<br/>}<br/>$dbh = null;
