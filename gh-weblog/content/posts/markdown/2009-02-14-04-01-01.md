# Improving punctuation for quotes.

Let us consider quotes. "This is a quote", is a quote, and the grammatically anal among you might go "oh my god you put the comma outside the quote!".

You'll also take exception to my use of an exclamation mark, then a closing quote, and then a full stop. 

<b>What the hell is wrong with you?</b>

Quotes indicate what was said; pulling interpunction into a quote makes absolutely no sense - it's not like the actual quote itself contained the comma, now did it? Same story for pulling full stops into quotes. My sentence ends with my full stop, not with someone else's full stop. Also, if the quote was yelled, then that doesn't mean my sentence has to be yelled too; why on earth would you pretend that only one -- normally -- sentence ending punctuation mark should be used in this case?

This post was mostly to say "you piss me off". Crazy anal-about-the-wrong-things people... Go combat improper spelling instead (and don't you dare talk about split infinitives... ENGLISH WAS NEVER LATIN, THE LATIN RULES OF GRAMMAR NEVER APPLIED!)

I love you all.
