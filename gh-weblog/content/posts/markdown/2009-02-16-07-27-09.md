# Death Race 2000.... 12?

I recently watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072856/" target="_blank">Death Race 2000</a>. A cult classic featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carradine" target="_blank">Carradine</a> and Stalone, and by today's standards a film so tame you can watch it with your parents and both chuckle.

Then today I watched the reinterpretation, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452608/" target="_blank">Death Race</a>, feating Statham, and noticed a few things. For one, it spends a good fifteen minutes setting up a plot point that would have been far better exposed as a brief mention once he's in prison. This isn't <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/" target="_blank">The Shawshank Redemption</a>, the film isn't plot driven. 

In fact, most of the film is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093894/" target="_blank">The Running Man</a> levels of "I am bored, let's watch some film entertaining. Aside from the film making the classic mistake that the villain has gotten where she is by being shrewd suddenly overplaying her hand, most of it is just explosions and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079501/" target="_blank">Mad Max</a> style cars.

The epilogue was completely pointless, but then a movie without any world outside the main event can't really be expected to give anything outside explosions and cars, and that's fine, except for the final frame.

I quote: "The motor vehicle action sequences depicted in this film are dangerous. all stunts were performed in controlled environments with professionally trained stunt crews on closed roads. no attempts should be made to duplicate any action, driving or car play scenes herein portrayed"

...

The only possible reason I can think of that makes sense for this text to appear before the credits roll (as opposed to, say, at the end of the credit for judicial purposes because the US rightfully assumes that on a population of 300 million, a low percentage of idiotic kids is still a hell of a lot of idiotic kids), is to actually get as many people as possible to reenact this movie in real life. If the film wasn't enough to make you fantasise about racing around killing each other, here's just an extra bit of nudge to make you go "jesus, how cool would this be if they have to warn me not to do this?"

I wonder if the US film industry can be sued for encouraging overt reverse psychology practices. It probably can.
