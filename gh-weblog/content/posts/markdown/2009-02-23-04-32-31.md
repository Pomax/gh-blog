# Remarkable People you never heard of.

<u>Norman Borlaug</u>



Norman received a Nobel prize for his services to humanity: he saved an estamated <b>one billion</b> lives, that's with a b, by moving to developing nations, and helping them develop and grow crops suitable for the local terrains. You could think of him as being single-handedly responsible for overpopulation, but overpopulation occurs when nations already have too much food, not in nations where people die every day from no food whatsoever. So really, he's roughly the biggest hero the world ever had.



Norman's still alive, and can be found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.



<u>Stan Meyer</u>



Meyer invented an engine that would let you fill it with water, it would do the hydrolisys for you, and would then derive power from the H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> reaction. Twenty years ago. It worked fine.



Stan died from food poisoning, and despite probably the most effective revolution in automotive research, never became known to the world. He doesn't even have a wikipedia page. He can be found mentioned on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDHT0hBgVOw" target="_blank">youtube</a>, and that's really not enough credit by far.
