# Raisin bread

I made a bit of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax/3334247924/" target="_blank">raisin bread</a>, and made the awesome mistake of deciding to do so around 6pm. So an hour later after the raisin'd soaked in warm water I whipped up some dough, tinned it, and then let it rise... right up to 10:40pm when I could start baking... which took until 11:15, and then the bread had to cool. Which for a full loaf of raisin bread takes about an hour. 



So now it's twelve thirty give or take a minute, my raisin bread looks <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax/3333412073/in/photostream/" target="_blank">delicious</a>, and I can finally go to bed... 



...having been tortured with the smell of raisin bread for over an hour now. And no midnight snacking for Pomax while he's trying to ditch some excess body fat T_T
