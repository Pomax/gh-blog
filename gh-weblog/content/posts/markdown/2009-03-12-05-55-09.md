# Formatting plain text in html?

What happens when you combine <a href="http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?t=200616" target="_blank">dynamic content distribution</a> with <a href="http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Totally_Pwn_CSS_with_Javascript" target="_blank">dynamic CSS manipulation</a>?

The simple answer is "whatever you make it do", but the more interesting answer is "the basis for a dynamically adjustable text formatting system", which lets you set up print pages in terms of page dimensions and print dimensions, and have it automatically generate the right number of pages as divs on the page.

Which is exactly what I need for evaluating my book rewrite. Paired with a bit of nifty php processing so my æ¼¢å­—(ãµã‚Š) notation becomes <ruby><rb>æ¼¢å­—</rb><rt>ãµã‚Š</rt></ruby> instead, and it's almost a work of magic.

Putting it all together's lead to <a href="http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/downloads/bookstyle/" target="_blank">this</a>, which works in Firefox 3, Webkit (Safari 4 and Chrome 1), Opera (9.5x) and IE7. So consider me quite happy. This was actually really fun to write.
