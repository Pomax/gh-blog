# I hate Opera

The browser, mind, not the artistic music and singing.

Why? Because as a developer I like to be able to write cross-browser material, and Opera doesn't let me. For instance, have some fun looking at <a href="http://unixpapa.com/js/mouse.html" target="_blank">mouse handling in js</a> across different browsers, and notice what Opera allows.

That's right, just one mouse button. I'm sorry, was the internet use moving to online applications, with their own context menus? Well too bad, Opera won't let you use those.

It also doesn't *tell* you it blocks things in its error console.

Thanks, Opera. Thanks to your idiocy I have to figure out some kind of idiotic button bar system now. I hope you fossilise soon (or experience a rebirth as a browser willing to move along with the internet. Even IE's trying, why aren't you?)
