# Need SQLite 2.8.17?

Need SQLite 2.8.17 but can't find it on <a href="http://www.sqlite.org" target="_blank">sqlite.org</a>? Then fret not, because it's still there, just not linked from the download page.

click <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-2_8_17.zip">http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-2_8_17.zip</a> to download it, or copy-paste that link if you don't trust direct filelinks (javascript might be making it look like a safe file O_o!)

As always, scan any files you download. Wouldn't want to be one of those millions of people who are responsible for spam, trojans and virusses infecting us all, do you?
