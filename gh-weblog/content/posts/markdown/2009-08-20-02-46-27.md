# Do you use dokuwiki?

If you do, then perhaps this <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:tabtables" target="_blank">plugin</a> that I wrote will be of use to you; it lets you use standard tab delimited tables in your wiki, turning it into proper tables when you view the page in a browser.

This allows you to keep your data as pure as possible (ie, not having to stick in annoying wiki tabling formatting) for processing by other programs or utilities.

Enjoy.
