# Photoshop CS4 without all the rest

I had to redo my computer setup, as I literally fried my system disk (ever seen an HD short circuit? There's a lot of smoke...) and that meant reinstalling Photoshop CS4. This time round I wanted to make sure I only installed what I needed, without all the crap Adobe's installer forces on you, so in the hopes that Adobe doesn't delete the post, instructions on how are <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/thread/548877" target="_blank">here</a>.

If they do, a verbatim copy:

All the dependencies that are not marked as "critical" in the proxy payload XML files for Bridge3All, CSIAll, Photoshop11-Core and Photoshop11-Core x64 need to be commented off, prior to running the installer. This will give you the ability to uncheck everything (except for Drive x64, which can be turned off by turning off the 32 bit version of Drive, so no loss there).
 
In order to just get Photoshop installed without all the unwanted/unnecessary components, the only things that need to be checked are:

<ul>
<li>CMaps (required for proper typesetting for fonts with CID maps, which you care about even if you don't know what that means)</li>
<li>All Color specifications</li>
<li>Photoshop (obviously)</li>
<li>Type Support (lets you type text in photoshop. rather essential)</li>
<li>XMP Panels (required for the user inferface)</li>
</ul>
 
Optional, but recommended:
 
<ul>
<li>Fonts (quite a number of good fonts, no reason not to install these)</li>
<li>Photoshop Support</li>
<li>Search for Help</li>
<li>Commoncolor components (if you care about synchronised/calibrated color work)</li>
<li>Update Manager (updates are good)</li>
</ul>
