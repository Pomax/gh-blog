# Computing bezier curve bounding boxes

Have you ever needed to compute the bounding box for a vector shape? You may have run into the problem that computing bounding boxes for lines is really easy, and that computing bounding boxes for arbitrary curves is, in fact, not. Not to worry! If you don't mind getting your brain dirty, <a href="/pages/bezier">I suffered this problem so that you don't have to</a>. Compute the bounding box for Bezier curves in the knowledge that math is on your side!
