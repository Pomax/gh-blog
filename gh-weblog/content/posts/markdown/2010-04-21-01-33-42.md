# Internationally Published Author

At long last, my book "An introduction to Japanese - Syntax, Grammar & Language" is properly published and available for purchasing. I will be selling autographed copies via http://www.sjgrpublishing.com and regular copies are available through amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/introduction-Japanese-Syntax-Grammar-Language/dp/9081507117/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1271837821&sr=8-1" target="_blank">US</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Japanese-Syntax-Gr/dp/9081507117/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1271837849&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Japanese-Syntax-Gr/dp/9081507117/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1271837691&sr=8-1" target="_blank">UK</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Introduction-Japanese-Syntax-Gr/dp/9081507117/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books-intl-de&qid=1271837797&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Germany</a> (since there's no amazon.eu) although that said, the German site seems to sell it at a price 100% higher than they should.

The book costs $30 (both US and Canadian), Â£20 (in UKish regions) and â‚¬20 for the European market. Amazon.de charges â‚¬39. I have no idea why.

Anyway, hurray for publication, now to move focus to sales!
