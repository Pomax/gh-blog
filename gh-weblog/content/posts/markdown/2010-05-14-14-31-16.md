# A simple website link mapper

Ever had the problem where you needed to do a forward and backlink analysis of a website? Sure, for a simple homepage it's pretty easy, and some blog software will let you do it, and if you like google analytics (why do you like google analytics?) that will conceivably be able to help you do it too, but sometimes you're like me, and you just want a tool to do the job for you. You're thinking of using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">wget</a>, but it doesn't actually do link mapping, just recursive webmirroring, so what are you to do...

Well, you download <a href="http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/downloads/getlinks.php.txt" target="_blank">this script</a>, rename it from getlinks.php.txt to getlinks.php and run it after you've run wget for the site you need to profile:

<blockquote>
shell> wget --output-file=result.log --no-cache --html-extension --no-cookies --recursive --domains=mywebsite.com --accept *.html http://www.mywebsite.com

shell> php getlinks.php > result.txt
</blockquote>

Job's a good'n.

And yes, I could have written it in PERL (heck, I already have several dirstructure traversing perl scripts for the various odds and ends jobs I do) but honestly, finding people who can actually READ perl code has become a rarity in and of itself. PHP is just as functional (oh, get off it, yes it is. I said functional. As in: it gets the bloody job done) and easier to read for most people who are passingly familiar with programming.
