# Thinking of buying Ziro?

If you're thinking of buying <a href="http://www.ziroworld.com/" target="_blank">Ziro</a>, the puzzle game, you may want to wait to see if the developers ever write a fix for the terrible mouse lag that the game suffers from. A game this simple (think iPhone app game) should not, and frankly speaking cannot, come with mouse lag. Yet it does. Terrible mouse lag. This makes the game utterly unplayable. Save your $5 or so for now. It really isn't worth the hatred you'll be spewing at your screen.
