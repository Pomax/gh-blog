# Writing a shoutbox

Because I'm migrating some of the functionality of <a href='http://www.nihongoresources.com' target='_blank'>nihongoresources</a> to a new domain, <a href='http://dictionaries.nihongoresources.com' target='_blank'>dictionaries.nihongoresources.com</a> I figured this was a good opportunity to let people voice their opinion in a less barrier, more direct way. Shoutbox style.

I tried a few premade ones, but they all had their own issues, so I figured I have enough technical skill, why not write one myself? After all, how hard can it be? This not being Top Gear, the answer is "not really that hard", you just need to make sure to do things in such a way that other people will be able to customise it easily. Because that means you'll be able too, as well.

The result is a pretty simple PHP SQLITE backend / JS CSS frontend shoutbox that uses the remarkably simple on-page code "<div id='shoutbox'></div>" and that's all you have to do (well, and load the shoutbox.js script of course).

It works well enough for me. To see an example in action, just head over that aforementioned <a href='http://dictionaries.nihongoresources.com' target='_blank'>dictionaries.nihongoresources.com</a>!
