# Bezier information for everyone

If you've ever wanted to know something about Bezier curves, there's a good chance I've covered it in my rather lenthly "Primer" on Bezier curves, conveniently located at <a href="http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/bezierinfo/">http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/bezierinfo/</a>.

And if it's not there, just ask and I shall probably add it to the article!
