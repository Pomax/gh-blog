# HTML5 meets Pomax

I like trying things because I have a need for them. One of the things I needed way back when I was writing the first revision for my book on Japanese grammar was a way to tell roughly how many pages of typeset material a plain text file would be.

What better way to check than using dynamically generated HTML, right? So I forgot I had ever written a utility that did just that, until a few days ago, when I realised I still had it lying around, and had everything I needed to clean it up and make it look fairly nice, too.

The result, <a href="http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/downloads/bookstyle/">I think you shall find</a>, is actually rather attractive.

Now I just need to figure out how to make it deal with all manner of HTML instead of just plain text. Should be a great WP/Drupal/Dokuwiki/etc theme!
