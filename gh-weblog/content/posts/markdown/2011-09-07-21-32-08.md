# Summer 2011 brings photographs

I've not been spending enough time posting entries, because I now have four websites on which I can post things when things happen, and no good solution (yet) on how to manage content between them...

That said, summer vacation 2011 consisted of visiting Ottawa, Missisauga, Waterloo, Toronto, and the Canadian Rocky Mountains (Canmore, Banff, Field and general hiking).

I'm going through my 2000 photographs that I shot for the more interesting ones, and the result so far can be viewed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax/sets/72157627475876053/">on Flickr</a>. More to come =)
