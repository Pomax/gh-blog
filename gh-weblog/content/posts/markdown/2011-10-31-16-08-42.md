# Get your simple page comments here.

So I needed something to add instant commenting to random pages I write (because I don't keep all my stuff on one website, and sometimes I'll make pages that have a limited lifetime but I'd still like comments for). So I dug into my Primer on Bezier curves, and ripped out the commenting functionality as it was the most modular starter I had lying around.

I cleaned that up, made it truly modular, and the result is a really quick and simple way to <a href="/pages/EasyPageComments">add a comment section to a page</a>. It only requires three lines of PHP to add comment functionality to any page, and is highly customisable thanks to nearly everything being CSS classed.

It's also <a href="http://github.com/Pomax/EasyPageComments">on github</a>
