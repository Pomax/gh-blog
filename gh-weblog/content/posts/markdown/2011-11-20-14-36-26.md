# Adding macros to your CSS without breaking things

For the redesign of Nihongoresources.com I needed CSS macros at the client. I like <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, but it doesn't let you keep shared design elements actually shared once the CSS it generate is loaded in a browser, so I needed something that kept those links in. <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> has a horrendous syntax, and is not CSS compatible, so I rolled my own macro package that sticks with the syntax that is used in proper CSS so that things work even if people block scripts.

<a href="http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/CSSmacros/">Get your CSS macros here.</a>

It also comes with a jQuery .macro() function, so you can change macro values even after the page has been loaded by the client's browser and be assured that everything that uses that macro is updated accordingly.
