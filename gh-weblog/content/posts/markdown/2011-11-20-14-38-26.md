# Trap keys for HTML elements - show the browser who's boss

Say you're writing a browser game. Everything's going great until your user hits "backspace" and BAM! The browser goes to the previous page. How annoying is that? Forget about annoying, it means your game is unplayable because it doesn't trap important keys.

With <a href="http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/KeyTrap/">this simple self-contained script</a>, it can. And it comes with a handy jQuery .trap() function, too, so that you can just chain it in wherever you like.

Now THAT's handy.
