# Load text with custom fonts when the font is ready.

Over the past year and a bit I've run into many occasions where it is ridiculously tricky to load a bit of text, styled with a custom font, because browsers don't know when a custom font is ready. They can tell that they finished downloading it, but then can't tell when it is also ready for typesetting (A large font can easily have 200ms between 'download complete' and 'fully parsed and ready for use').

The solution: through my own work on font parsing, work I did for <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a>, and a P.O.C. for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js">PDF.js</a> I have now come up with (almost) the perfect solution: Font.js, a library that adds a sorely missing object to the JavaScript toolbox, namely a "new Font()" object.
