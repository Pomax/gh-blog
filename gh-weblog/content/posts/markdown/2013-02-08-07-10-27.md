# A simple thimble button

I've been working on <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>'s <a href="http://webmaker.org">webmaker</a> program for a while now, and one of the things we run into is that we all want a million features, but only have so many people working on it. I'd love a nice UI-integrated way to slide between "code view" and "preview view", and a number of people have been brainstorming about this and coming up with amazing things, but they're going to take considerable work to put in, and as is the way with dev work, it won't be in until it's in.

So for my own <a href="http://thimble.webmaker.org">Thimble</a> work, I figured I'd write a bookmarklet that lets me slide between 'preview' and 'sourced'. It's only a few lines of JS, it's completely untested, it's not integrated into the code base, but it certainly works a treat!

If all went well, just drag the following link into your bookmark bar, and the next time you thimble it up, hit that button!

<a style='border: 1px solid #99F;border-radius: 5px;padding: 0px 3px;background-color: #EEF;margin: auto;display: block;width: 15em;text-align: center;' href='javascript:(function($) { var previewOnly = false, sourcePane = $.querySelector(".source-code"), previewPane = $.querySelector(".preview-holder"), header = $.querySelector(".project-info"), button = $.createElement("button"); button.setAttribute("class","wm-button wm-button-blue short enabled"); button.innerHTML = "view preview"; button.onclick = function() { previewOnly = !previewOnly; var left = previewOnly? 0 : 50, right = previewOnly? 100 : 50; button.innerHTML = (previewOnly ? "view source" : "view preview"); sourcePane.style.width = left + "%"; previewPane.style.width = right + "%"; }; header.parentNode.insertBefore(button, header); }(document))'>A Thimble preview sliding bookmarklet</a>
