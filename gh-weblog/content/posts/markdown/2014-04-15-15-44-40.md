We had someone drop into the [#webmaker](irc:mozilla.org/webmaker) channel the other day who wanted to give our full [webmaker suite](https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-suite) a spin. Generally this means they clone the webmaker-suite repository, follow the [pre-flight instructions](https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-suite#preflight) to make sure they have all the necessary tools installed, and then off they go. Fire off a `node install-webmaker` and 20 minutes later a million projects have been checked out, instantiated, and linked up to work together.

But not this time.

You see that "20 minutes later" only works if you never lose your connection. And don't run into weird OS-specific glitches. And when you do —and this time of course we did— you're faced with restarting that install from scratch. Another 20 minutes. And pray you don't run into something else.

Which of course kept happening.

So (in retrospect way too late) we added [install tracking](https://github.com/mozilla/webmaker-suite/issues/24) to the webmaker suite - if at any point the installation crashes, or you interrupt it, you can use the `--fast-forward` flag to make it simply resume where it got interrupted. Now, at worse, it's going to be 20 minutes over several few-minute chunks as you fix the problems that prevent the install from finishing, but you never have to restart from scratch again.

`$> node install-webmaker --fast-forward`

Solving real problems for humans is important.
