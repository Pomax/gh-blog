So here's an interesting thing.  I've been working on a cursive typeface, although it's not "type" (and let's be fair, cursive and hand-written are two different things. If someone would like to link me to why they're not, I'd highly appreciate that), and one of the defining features is something that cannot be done by OpenType fonts.

Some of you might go "well, okay", and not realise quite how powerful OpenType fonts are. The fact that I need something from OpenType is pretty special. So, what do I need? My typeface's f and t have cross bars that should extend "to the ends of the word", or a vertical, if that gets in the way. Opentype cannot do this. So, what to do?

Well, I'm going to have to suggest 2 new OpenType tables to effect glyph modification (after GPOS/GSUB routines have finished) for moving/modyfing groups of outline points, and a "grrp" table for glyph groups, with each glyph id able to specify groups of vertices that count as "a group" that can be modified.

Modifications that would be group-applicable would include any 2D tranformation, point alignment based on other-glyph points and general relative metrics, and supgrouping followed by doing the same thing.  A casual skytrain-ride workout of this would be the following:
