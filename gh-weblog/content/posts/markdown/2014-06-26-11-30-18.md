Say you had some legacy code that used [SQLite2 API calls](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sqlite.php) (`sqlite_open`, `sqlite_query`, `sqlite_fetch_all` and `sqlite_close`, specifically), and your host forced everything over to PHP 5.4, so you need an emergency fix. Bad news: your sqlite2 data is now useless unless you force-reinstall Sqlite2 support from [PECL](http://pecl.php.net/). If, however, you're using SQLite files for caching (which is really the only thing you should be using them for anyway) then you can use an [emergency shim](https://gist.github.com/Pomax/b9fd11d872a72be73317) to keep things running until you can make the time to do a full update.
