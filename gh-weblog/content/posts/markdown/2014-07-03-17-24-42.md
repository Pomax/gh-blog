In the past, the grammar book was served as a dokuwiki on [grammar.nihongoresources.com](http://grammar.nihongoresources.com), but this has become a poor solution: it's too much work to maintain. Instead, I've revisited the idea of having it live on [Github](http://github.com/Pomax/nrGrammar) so that concurrent edits are easy, and quick edits are genuinely quick.

So I've taken the dokuwiki data, have a syntax-interpreter that turns it into sensible HTML, and a loader that loads the book into your browser as straight up HTML data, with a mostly inoffensive navigation system, and can now set it up in the [api.nihongoresources.com](http://api.nihongoresources.com) `public` dir with x-frame embedding allowed, and then the main [nihongoresources.com](http://nihongoresources.com) site can simply load up the data as an iframe embed when people want to read up on the grammar.

And if you want to contribute: simply go to github, click through to the file you want to change, hit the "edit" button, and make your changes. Happy? Describe the changes, make a pull request, and it shows up in my inbox as a "someone's suggesting we make this change to the code" notice. Super handy!

Things are just getting better and better.
