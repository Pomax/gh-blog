I spend a decent amount of time during my vacation bringing [Nihongo Resources](http://www.nihongoresources.com) into the new decade by setting up a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) app on a [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) droplet to act as dedicated search API. The result [can be found here](http://api.nihongoresources.com) and it works quite well. It can perform html and json searches, although because it does server-side gzip, nihongoresources.com consumes it as straight up html, with some preprocessing to ensure the style makes sense when the result is embedded on the nihongoresources.com website.

That means that I can start weening the website off of PHP entirely, which will be nice - most of the content is static, except for the searching, the "learn kanji", and the grammar book. The first has been tackled, the second is going to get tackled soon by taking advantage of the infrastructure that the API service point now uses, and the latter is the subject of the next post on this blog.

Good times!
