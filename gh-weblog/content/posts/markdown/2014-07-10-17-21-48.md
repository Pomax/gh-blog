I have a few fountain pens (this should not be too much of a surprise) and I have this lovely ecoline paint that I'm using as ink. Which works, but requires some care because if it dries up in the pen, it's quite a bit of soaking to get it all dissolved again and get the pen writing smoothly. Since ecoline is not really the smartest ink, I figured I'd try to find an ink that is close in colour from the wide range of worldly-available-inks, but perusing sites like [Goulet Pens)(http://www.gouletpens.com/Shop_All_Bottled_Ink_s/1106.htm?searching=Y&sort=7&cat=1106&brand=Noodler%27s&show=300&page=1) never seems to offer a way to sort on colours, which is the only sorting I'm truly interested in.

So, let's just write some JavaScript to sort on hue!

This was generated with a bookmarklet Proof of Concept that I quickly wrote up [here](http://jsbin.com/dutelaje/6), with the code that makes everything work up as a [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/Pomax/0dec927f805f7c0af5b2), minified for bookmarkletting using [JSCompress](http://jscompress.com).

Pretty happy with the result, now to get people to use it on their ink-selling websites =)
