[Thimble](http://thimble.webmaker.org), Mozilla's [Webmaker](http://webmaker.org) tool for learning "how to HTML" (with CSS and JavaScript) has some nice features that might not be highlighted as much as they should be, due to how they work. One of those is the tutorial functionality, which is pretty damn awesome, but also fairly under-highlighted. The way tutorials work is up for a redesign, but in the mean time it's definitely cool enough to tell you what it is, and how it works.

If you've ever seen Thimble, you might recognise the following screen:

but you might notice there's nothing to tell you what's going on. This is an HTML editor, and that's not particularly exciting. Or educational, for that matter. Let's change that.

Thimble comes with a way to attach "any other page" as a guide-page to go along with a thimble project. An example of this is the movie poster tutorial that you get when you start this project as a [starter make](https://artychan.makes.org/thimble/movie-poster/remix), which is actually just another page made with Thimble, but with some special bits added in:

Tutorials have some CSS and JavaScript linked into them to make them look and act nice with Thimble, and you can see in the screenshot that it loads up some customg CSS, a version of [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and a custom .js file for tutorials. With that added, All we have to do is write each step in our tutorial as a `<section>...</section>` and done. This will now behave as a tutorial for another make.

So, how do we actually add a tutorial to a make? Right now, there are no obvious buttons to use, but adding is still pretty simple: in the same way that you can tag makes as "#cats" or "#webmaking" or "#makerparty2014", you can tag a make with -not just one, but as many as you need- "#tutorial-..." tags.

Let's say we published our tutorial to [https:/artychan.makes.org/thimble/movie-poster-tutorial](https://artychan.makes.org/thimble/movie-poster-tutorial), then in the movie poster project, we can publish the poster with a tag `tutorial-https:/artychan.makes.org/thimble/movie-poster-tutorial`:

And that's it! Now, when anyone loads up our make in Thimble in their browser (or we just hit reload to see the effect ourselves) we now have a shiny fancy tutorial attached to the project, and people can follow the instructions that you intended for them!

But wait, there's more, because tutorials can also point you to where in the code something important needs to be done. In order to make that part as easy as possible, the tutorial javascript that gets loaded has some magic that will convert things like "line 12" and "lines 10-15" into actual line pointers: once loaded up in Thimble, they become links that you can click, which will then automatically scroll Thimble to the relevant line(s) so people don't have to dig through the project's HTML just find what you're talking about.

In fact, if the line(s) to scroll to are off screen, Thimble which show you whether they're up or down:

And clicking the line(s) link then takes you where you need to be:

Super handy!

As mentioned, the user experience is not perfect, but it's certainly functional enough to let everyone add tutorials to their projects if they want, and hopefully over the summer the Webmaker team can revisit how tutorials are added to projects to streamline the creation/stubbing/attaching of them. In the mean time, tutorials on everything O_O
