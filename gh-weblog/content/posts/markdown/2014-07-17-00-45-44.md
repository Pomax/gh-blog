So I bought some inks to match the Royal Talens Ecoline watercolor (311, vermillion) that I have a dwindling supply of, which despite the many claims by crappy internet stores is a reddish pink, rather than kind of orange. So I did two things. 1) I hit up [deSerres](http://www.deserres.ca/en-ca/search/ecoline-watersoluble-ink/ECOLINE) to stock up on Ecoline again, and I visited [Goulet Pens](gouletpens.com/Shop_All_Bottled_Ink_s/1106.htm) to buy some reds/pinks to see what matched.

Turns out, the closest that I ordered was Diamine Pink, and it's actually rather lovely! It might look fairly different in this image, but the paper this was drawn on is actually kind of shitty and it blots the Ecoline like mad - on my regular $2 writing pad they actually look pretty similar, but the Diamine is just a tiny bit lighter, and quite lovely.

I also bought some [Heart of Darkness](http://noodlersink.com/whats-new/heart-of-darkness), a "bulletproof" black (which came with a [really cool free pen](http://noodlersink.com/writing-instruments/the-rollerball-pen) - decent fountain pen, but has a rollerball tip too... an ink rollerball point O_O), and some [Whiteness of the Whale]((http://www.gouletpens.com/Noodlers_Whiteness_of_the_Whale_Ink_1oz_p/n19807.htm), which is a UV ink and looks milky in the bottle, but clear when you write with it. I might use that to mix some inks and see what the result is.

Most of all: this will keep writing fun =)
