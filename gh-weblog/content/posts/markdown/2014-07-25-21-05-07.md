So I've been thinking about a post-GPOS/GSUB approach for tweaking glyph outlines to shape themselves based on the context they're used in, and I think I'm going to take the coming weekend to throw together an [opentype.js](https://nodebox.github.io/opentype.js) + GMOD mockup, so that what I'm drawing on paper,

is actually something that I can play with in terms of defining a minimal `ggrp` (glyph groups) table and a minimal `GMOD` (glyph modification) common format table, and see how much is needed to get some nice functionality that highlights why I think it will be useful to have this as part of OpenType.
