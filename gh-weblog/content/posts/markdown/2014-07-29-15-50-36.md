I bought a new [Wacom Intuos](http://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Intuos-Medium-Tablet-CTH680/dp/B00EN27UC2) to replace the old first generation Intuos I had but couldn't use because nothing supports it (yes, first gen. We're talking over a decade ago) and figured the best way to test it would be to draw one of the animals Arty and I have been playing around with as concept for a while.

He's good friends with Square Bear and Triangle Tiger, but those stories will have to come some other day.
