Over the last few weeks I've been testing some fountain pen inks, where "some" means 168 (plus two Indian Blacks, which are nothing like fountain pen ink and never, ever, use a fountain pen with them), getting a good view on which colours are out there, and who might make the kind of ink I like working with.

The [result](http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/inks) is a photodump at the moment of all the swatches I made, and I will be turning this into a color selector of inks probably later this week so you can say "I want an [orange] ink", get a random orange, and can then navigate your way through hue and/or saturation and/or brightness to find what you like best.

That said, it's only 170 inks. Out of literally well over a thousand inks out there. Feel free to buy me more inks to test >_>
