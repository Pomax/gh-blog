After lots of fountain pen ink [sample testing](http://www.gouletpens.com/Random_Ink_Sample_Package_Set_p/package-inksamples.htm), purchased through [The Goulet Pen Company](http://gouletpens.com)'s amazing sampler notion, and wanting to capture them as an indexed, searchable data pool, I decided to set up an [inkcyclopedia](http://inkcyclopedia.org) over at [inkcyclopedia.org](http://inkcyclopedia.org).

<img src="/gh-weblog-2/images/inkcyclopedia-main-view.jpg" class="border">

This lets me find inks based on their colour (or technically, their hue at the moment) as well as filter by company and ink name. It also lets me add new inks as I try them through an upload system that does image analysis to figure out the color of the ink, using [RGB quantization](https://github.com/leeoniya/RgbQuant.js).

The quantization will find the 10 most used colours and lets you pick any of them (if the real colour isn't in there, that's a sign you have cleanup work left to do on the image!)  so that if it finds a background color as "most dominant" you can still pick the true colour, and you can select a part of the image to act as representative crop, so that the inkcyclopedia can give people browsing it an indication of what the ink really looks like on paper, rather than a flat RGB swatch.

Also, see that "logout" button? The site uses [Persona](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona) login (using the most excellent [express-persona](https://www.npmjs.org/package/express-persona) module), which means that I never get a password from you, you simply log in with your email and I'll trust your mail server to know who you are. That way you don't need to deal with yet another login, and I don't need to pretend to know what I'm doing when it comes to security.  Everybody wins. I'm still working on [the features](https://github.com/pomax/inkcyclopedia/issues) to tie to your account, but it's going to be things you want, like "I own these" and "I want these" lists, saves quick selections, notes you left on inks, etc.

After about [250 samples](#gh-weblog-1407948773020) and at least [three](http://imgur.com/gallery/5TGYc) [imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery/4sVTk) [albums](http://imgur.com/gallery/3JWW4), I've at least have been able to come up with a shortlist of colours I'd like to own for my writing, and having played around with some Noodler's Ink's ["Konrad"](http://www.gouletpens.com/Noodlers_Konrad_Flex_Nib_Pens_s/1264.htm) flex pens, realised I want a "real" flex pen, so also bought a [Pilot Falcon](http://www.gouletpens.com/Pilot_Namiki_Falcon_Fountain_Pens_s/949.htm), with rhodium trim, because I'm not a fan of yellow gold.

In case you're curious about my shortlist, it's:

Oh right. Did I mention it was [open source](http://github.com/pomax/inkcyclopedia)? Because it is. The code's licensed, so you can't just fork it and host your own (you can fork it and run it on your own computer though!) but you can examine the code as much as you like and recommend improvements, or even file Pull Requests if you think you know how to add in something that I'm not adding fast enough for you.

And if you just want to leave feedback, there's always the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pomax/inkcyclopedia/issues)
