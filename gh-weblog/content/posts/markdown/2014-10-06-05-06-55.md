I was asked if I would be willing to write an SVG path-to-outline conversion library, and figured I might as well set up some jump boards for doing that. One of those is [Bezier.js](http://pomax.github.io/bezierjs) which I "released" today (meaning it has working code and a demo, but no registered npm/bower entries yet).

It's a small bezier curve library that does the essential things like generating plot points, derivatives, normals, inflection points, curve offsetting, etc. Give the demo a try, and read through [the example code](https://github.com/Pomax/bezierjs/blob/gh-pages/beziertest.js). It's pretty easy!
