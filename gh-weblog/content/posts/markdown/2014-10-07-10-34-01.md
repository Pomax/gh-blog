Updating [inkcyclopedia](http://inkcyclopedia.org) with some more inks to fill in the gaps (oh yes.. there are gaps...) so I've added some loose ends (like ink lines of which I had most-except-4-to-7) which is [imgur](http://imgur.com) album'd [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/7rXCP), and there will be a few larger batches added when I have time. I have an additional 70 de Atramentis inks sitting on the table waiting for when I have time to pen them up, after that it's probably just going to be the remaining Diamine and Noodler's Inks and then there'll be a stupid amount of inks on the site and it's utility will come from being useful when selecting inks. Meaning I need to get on those improvements for viewing samples and getting stats about the inks (composition, flowiness, feathering, shading, wetness,  etc. etc. etc).
