2 weeks ago, on a Saturday, I thought I'd revisit my old [PHP-based](http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/downloads/mjscoring) [mahjong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong) scoring application. We like playing Chinese Classical rules, which are a little more "fun" and a little less "optimised for gambling" that the usual rules, and one aspect of that is that it's much harder to track scores: everyone pays the winner, but the losers settle score differences amongst themselves in addition to paying the winner, too, and there's a fair number of different things to score. Plus, you can get both points and "doubles", the latter of which doubles (surprise!) your total point score. Only 28 tile points but 5 doubles? That's 896 points total.

On that fateful Saturday, I decided I'd put [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) to the test, and see if it'd hold up. I was doing my dev work in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com) and [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), and that combination worked just fine. And then after a day and a few hours on sunday, I tried it in [Firefox](http://firefox.com), and all my joy turned to hatred as the app broke all over the place. Polymer plain old didn't work (and at this point, sad to say, Polymer is dead to me). The bits that did we slow, the bits that didn't ultimately gave me too much of a headache trying to fix specifically for Firefox. I literally gave up: it was easy to port, too bad technology let me down.

However, as per the previous post, the Mozilla Foundation engineering team is considering using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react), and what better way to learn it than to take that broken Polymer app, and rewrite it as a React app? Long story short: a week later I ported the app from Polymer to React, and React works brilliantly in all browsers (yes, IE11 and Android 4.2 work) and is *fast* too boot. So... I have a new app up and running for scoring mahjong, and that makes me happy!

You can find it over on [http://pomax.github.io/mjscoring.js](http://pomax.github.io/mjscoring.js), with the source code living over on [github](https://github.com/pomax/mjscoring.js) and I've been using it along side some games played in [Four Winds Mahjong](https://www.4windsmj.com) (which may look old, but is still the best at actually seriously playing MJ that I know of) to see if the scoring holds up, and after some initial bug fixing, it feels like it's doing just that. No more having to rely on a set of unmaintanable old PHP scripts anymore, and I even wrote it so that it'll be relatively easy to add in new scoring rules, for when you prefer to play HK rules. Which can be nice sometimes, if you don't want the cut-throat "I need to destroy you, you're winning too much, but first I need to become east" excitement that Chinese Classical rules bring to the table.

Game on.
