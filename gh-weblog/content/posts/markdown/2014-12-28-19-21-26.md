Sometimes you see [a tweet](https://twitter.com/mikeaich/status/544976045313503232) that points to [a post](http://wtfjs.com/2013/02/12/obfuscated-fibonacci) and you leave what is the comment equivalent of a wink, but then things spiral out of control...

What does an obfuscated [Lucas series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number) generator look like? (Note: not [Lucas sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_sequence), because that's a very different thing).

To answer this, a quick bit of nifty: you know the Fibonacci series. Even if you don't, it takes almost no time to explain: it starts as 1, 1 and then the next term is the sum of the previous two, so it goes 1, 1, then 2 (1+1), then 3 (2+1), then 5 (3+2), 8 (5+3), and so forth. The Lucas series starts with 2,1 instead, so we get 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, and so forth.

Now, any series like this (doesn't matter which 2 numbers you start with) ends up with a "[golden ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)" between any number `n` and the previous number `n-1`, in that `f(n)/f(n-1)` tends to the golden ratio value, the higher `n` gets. For the Fibonacci series, the fun ends there.

BUT!

The Lucas series is really cool. Let's call the golden ratio φ, and the number in the Lucas series simply "lucas(...). Then : lucas(1) = 2, lucas(2) = 1, lucas(3) = 3, lucas(4) = 4, lucas(5) = 7, lucas(6) = 11, etc. But now check this out: φ<sup>1</sup> ≈ 1.618, φ<sup>2</sup> ≈ 2.618,  φ<sup>3</sup> ≈ 4.236, φ<sup>4</sup> ≈ 6.854, φ<sup>5</sup> ≈ 11.090,  φ<sup>6</sup> ≈ 17.944, φ<sup>7</sup> ≈ 29.034, etc.

Notice anything? What if we round those ratio powers?

φ<sup>1</sup> ≈ 2, φ<sup>2</sup> ≈ 3,  φ<sup>3</sup> ≈ 4, φ<sup>4</sup> ≈ 7, φ<sup>5</sup> ≈ 11, φ<sup>6</sup> ≈ 18, φ<sup>7</sup> ≈ 29, etc.

We see that lucas(n) is equivalent to φ<sup>n-1</sup>, if we round the latter. This isn't just for the first few terms, either, this holds true for *every* lucas number. That's amazing! It's so amazing that there's a [numberphile youtube video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeUbRXnbmms).

Okay, so let's figure out the obfuscation. In Javascript `+[]` is the number 0, because JS will see a `+` and try to interpret what follows as a number. Normally `[]` is an empty array, but due to some very interesting rules, an empty array can be coerced to the number zero if absolutely necessary, so JS will do this for us. We can get the number 1 in a variety of ways, but the one used in Mike's tweet is `++[+[]][+[]]`, which is equivalent to `++[0][0]`. You might understand this immediately if I said `var array = [0]; ++array[0];`, because that's obviously going to give 1. Clever.

Now then, let's get cracking! First off, let's generate the golden ratio in minimal JS. One of the interesting things about the golden ratio is that you can write it as an infinitely [continued fraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) involving only the number 1: it's 1, plus 1/... where the ... is 1 + 1/..., in which *that* ... is 1 + 1/... in which **that** ... is 1 + 1/... in whi-- well you get the idea.

If we do that in reverse, we can build the golden ratio by starting with some `r = 1` and then running `r = 1 + 1/r` a large number of times. This'll generate the series 1, 2, 1.5, 1.666..., 1.6, 1.625, 1.615384, ..., 1.6180371352785146, ..., 1.6180339631667064, and if we run it long enough, something starting with 1.618033988749895, in which those 16 significant digits don't change. That's good enough for me.

In fact, I'll settle for 1.618033988749989, which is what you get if we run that `r = 1 + 1/r` 32 times.

Let's Javascriptify:

```
for(r = 1, s = 32; s>0; r = 1 + 1/r, s--); r
```

Good start. Rewriting time:

```
for(r = ++[+[]][+[]], s = 32; s>+[]; r = ++[+[]][+[]] + (++[+[]][+[]]/r), s--); r
```

Now for that s... I picked 32 for a reason, because if we use some bit shifting, it's 1 << 6, or 2 << 2 << 2, and 2 is pretty easy to get when we already have `r = 1`:

```
r = ++[+[]][+[]];
s = ++[r][+[]]<<++[r][+[]]<<++[r][+[]]
```
Splendid, we now have `r=1` and `s=32`:
```
for(r = ++[+[]][+[]], s = ++[r][+[]]<<++[r][+[]]<<++[r][+[]]; s>+[]; r = ++[+[]][+[]] + (++[+[]][+[]]/r),
 s--); r
```
Still too readable though, let's replace `r` with `_` and `s` with `__`:
```
for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]];__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);_
```
Nice. In fact, let's increase our accuracy just a little bit more with one more shift:
```
for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_), __--);_
```
And now we get 1.618033988749895 when we run this. Golden ratio found!

Now for the Lucas numbers:
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_), __--);
  return Math.round(Math.pow(_, n-1));
}
```
But of course that's again way too readable. Let's drop those Math.functions:
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_), __--);
  return (0.5 + Math.pow(_, n-1)) | 0;
}
```
A little better: Javascript can be tricked into floor-rounding by using any bit operation, so `6.34 | 0` becomes 6, as does `6.34 << 0` (shift by 0 bits) or `6.34 >> 0` (also shift, opposite direction). If instead of floor rounding we want normal rounding, we have to add 0.5 first. But we only have integers in our obfuscated code, so we use 1 divided by 2:
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_), __--);
  return (1/2 + Math.pow(_, n-1)) | 0;
}
```
Let's get obfuscating
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);
  return (++[+[]][+[]]/++[++[+[]][+[]]][+[]] + Math.pow(_, n-1)) | 0;
}
```
Sweet. We get 2 from exploiting the trick we used for 1: ++[0][0] is one, ++[1][0] is two, ++[2][0] is three, etc... but now to get rid of Math.pow: as you'll recall from basic arithmetic, a<sup>b</sup> is just `a*a*...*a` with `b-1` multiplications, so:
```
for(var temp = a, b = ...; --b>0; a *= temp); a
```
Easy enough:
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);
  for(var temp = _, b = n-1; --b>0; _ *= temp);
  return (++[+[]][+[]]/++[++[+[]][+[]]][+[]] + _) | 0;
}
```
But let's get rid of that `b`, too, since we already have `n` and it doesn't matter what happens to it:
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);
  for(var temp = _; --n+1>0; _ *= temp);
  return (++[+[]][+[]]/++[++[+[]][+[]]][+[]] + _) | 0;
}
```
Nice! One last trick we can use is that in Javascript `if (... !== 0)` can be shortcircuited by exploiting the fact that JS will try to turn something into a conditional if it isn't one, so we can say `if (...)`:
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);
  for(var temp = _; --n+1; _ *= temp);
  return (++[+[]][+[]]/++[++[+[]][+[]]][+[]] + _) | 0;
}
```
Now, we can use `__` as our temp var, since we won't need it anymore, and we're pretty much done:
```
function lucas(n) {
  for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);
  for(__=_;-++[+[]][+[]]+n--;_*=__);
  return (++[+[]][+[]]/++[++[+[]][+[]]][+[]] + _) | 0;
}
```
And as  whitespace isn't semantic, let's remove all of that:
```
function l(n){for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+
(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);for(__=_;-++[+[]][+[]]+--n;_*=__);return(++[+[]][+[]]/++[++[+[]][+[]]][+[]]+_)|+[];}
```

Done! If we call this as `l(1)` we'll get stuck in an infinite loop, but that's okay, as we can only start generating as of the 3rd Lucas number anyway. If we do, `l(3)` is 3, `l(4)` is 4, `l(5)` is 7, `l(6)` is 11, and so on.

Thanks for letting me waste your time.

**update**: You might have spotted an "optimisation" here, because `__` is 1.[something], so `__|0` is 1. We can use this in our return statement to further compact while staying utterly unreadable:
```
function l(n){for(_=++[+[]][+[]],__=++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<++[_][+[]]<<_;__>+[];_=++[+[]][+[]]+
(++[+[]][+[]]/_),__--);for(__=_;-++[+[]][+[]]+--n;_*=__);return(__|0/++[__|0][+[]]+_)|+[];}
```
We could also use `__|0/(__|0)<<__|0` but that's actually far more readable, so let's not.
