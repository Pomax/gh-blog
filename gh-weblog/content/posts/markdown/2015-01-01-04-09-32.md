I rewrote my blog software to be easier to maintain (despite having no real desire to need to - if it works, it should just work) as well as easier to have others install and use it. The new version has been implemented as a [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) application, using [marked.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) as the Markdown parser, and [octokit.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/octokit) as the interface to github. Before, posts were rather ugly .json files on github, but the new version makes that `.json` files for the metadata, and `.md` files for the actual posts, so if you want to edit them after you posted them outside of the blog itself, it's now super simple.

There's an admin panel now, too, which is getting some bits like letting you say (based on your *current browser localStorage*) what your credentials are, and will include things like saying which tags should have dedicated RSS feeds (for instance, in addition to the general [rss.xml](gh-weblog/rss.xml), I need a feed for Mozilla-only posts). I'll be adding a few more things, maybe, like a calendar filter and a "titles only" view, but for the most part this thing is virtually done now, and really just needs packing up.

I'm trying to figure out how to combine React code with mixins in a way that lets me gulp-pack-browserify-uglify the whole shebang, so hopefully that works and then you can add this to your own Github pages site by simply including a one line script in your .html -- we'll see how far I get with that.
