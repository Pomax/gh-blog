I rewrote my blog software to be easier to maintain (despite having no real desire to need to - if it works, it should just work) as well as easier to have others install and use it. The new version has been implemented as a React application, using `marked.js` as the Markdown parser, and `octokit.js` as the interface to github. Before, posts were rather ugly .json files on github, but the new version makes that `.json` files for the metadata, and `.md` files for the actual posts, so if you want to edit them after you posted them outside of the blog itself, it's now super simple.
