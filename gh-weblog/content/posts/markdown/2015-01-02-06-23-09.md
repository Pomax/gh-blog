## A Quickstart Guide

By far the easiest way to install your own copy of this Github blog is to head on over to [http://github.com/pomax/gh-blog](http://github.com/pomax/gh-blog) and click the "fork" button, so that you get a copy of the gh-blog repository, but on your own account. 

If you just want to install it to play with it, there's only three steps left:

## Edit `index.html` to match your username and repository

By default the repository will have an `index.html` file that points to this specific page on http://pomax.github.io/gh-blog, but if you've forked it, that location will have changed. Go to `https://github.com/YourUserName/gh-blog/edit/gh-pages/index.html` and change the "base" property to point to your fork, rather than to these instructions.

Two steps left!

## Getting credentials so that you can edit/modify/delete posts directly

Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/applications) for your new repository by opening that link in a new tab, and clicking [generate new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Create a new token with **only repo and public_repo access**. The blog platform doesn't need any other rights, so don't make a token with more permissions for it.

Give the token a description like "access token for my github blog" or something, and then click the "generate token" button.

**note: make sure to save the token this generates somewhere**, github will not ever show you this token again, so if you forget to copy it before moving on, you'll just have to delete the token and make a new one. This might sound inconvenient, but it also means things are a little more secure.

Just one more step, and you'll be off running your own blog off your own Github account:

## Authenticating yourself so you can use your new blog

Open your blog in the browser by going to http://YourUserName.github.io/gh-blog (with, obviously, your username substituted), and click the "admin" link. This will pop up a dialog that you will have to fill in.

- For "username", fill in your github user name
- For "repository", fill in *gh-blog*
- For "branch", fill in *gh-pages*
- For "path", fill in *gh-weblog*

Finally, fill in your Github Personal Access Token in the token field, and then click anywhere outside the dialog. That's it, you're in!
