## A Quickstart Guide

By far the easiest way to install your own copy of this Github blog is to head on over to [http://github.com/pomax/gh-blog](http://github.com/pomax/gh-blog) and click the "fork" button, so that you get a copy of the gh-blog repository, but on your own account. 

If you just want to install it to play with it, that's all you have to do in terms of "getting the code".
