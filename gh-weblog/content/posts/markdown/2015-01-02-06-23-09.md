# A four step Quickstart Guide... Step 1: fork it!

By far the easiest way to install your own copy of this Github blog is to head on over to [http://github.com/pomax/gh-blog](http://github.com/pomax/gh-blog) and click the "fork" button, so that you get a copy of the gh-blog repository, but on your own account.

If you just want to install it to play with it, there's only three steps left:

# Step 2: Edit `index.html` to match your username and repository

By default the repository will have an `index.html` file that points to this specific page on http://pomax.github.io/gh-blog, but if you've forked it, that location will have changed. Point your browser at **`https://github.com/YourUserName/gh-blog/edit/gh-pages/index.html`** and change the `base` property to point to your fork, rather than to these instructions.

You probably also want to edit the `<title>` element all the way at the top to read something more personalised, and similarly, change the `title` and `description` properties for the WebLog element, in the same place you changed the `base` property.

Two steps left!

# Step 3: Getting credentials so that you can edit/modify/delete posts directly

Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/applications) for your new repository by opening that link in a new tab, and clicking [generate new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Create a new token with **only repo and public_repo access**. The blog platform doesn't need any other rights, so don't make a token with more permissions for it.

Give the token a description like "access token for my github blog" or something, and then click the "generate token" button.

**note: make sure to save the token this generates somewhere**, github will not ever show you this token again, so if you forget to copy it before moving on, you'll just have to delete the token and make a new one. This might sound inconvenient, but it also means things are a little more secure.

Just one more step, and you'll be off running your own blog, straight from your own Github account:

# Step 4: Authenticating yourself so you can use your new blog

Open your blog in the browser by going to http://YourUserName.github.io/gh-blog (with, obviously, your username substituted), and click the "admin" link. This will pop up a dialog that you will have to fill in.

- For "username", fill in your github user name
- For "repository", fill in *gh-blog*
- For "branch", fill in *gh-pages*
- For "path", fill in *gh-weblog*

Which would look like this:

Finally, fill in your Github Personal Access Token in the token field, and then click anywhere outside the dialog.

That's it, you're done! Every time you come back to your blog in the browser you're using right now, you'll be authenticated already. Want to authenticate on a public computer? Click the "log out" button once you're done to make the browser completely forget everything you filled in. This blogging platform uses absolutely zero cookies!)

# Writing new posts, editing posts, deleting posts

To write a new post, click the "new entry" button in the upper right, then click the `"...click here to start editing your post..."` and you can start writing your entry. For convenience a new entry already has a title and a sample text which you can edit, or you can just delete them entirely if you want to start with an empty text area.

There is no "save" button. Instead, clicking anywhere outside of the text area will save your post. Just don't immediately close the browser or tab when you do, because the platform needs to send the post over to github, which takes at most a few seconds.

To edit a post, simply click the post's main text body. The post will turn into the text editor again and you can modify it as much as you like. Click anywhere outside the text area and the update post will be saved again.

To delete a post, click the "delete entry" button. You'll have to confirm that you *really* want to delete a post, because we don't want to delete posts by accident, but if you really want to delete it, confirm your intent and your post will disappear from your blog. However, because you're running your blog on github, that delete is just another commit in your revision history, so you can always get a post back even if you accidentally deleted it on purpose, by accident.

To add tags to a post, click on the "Tagged with:" in the lower right, and add some tags (comma separated). Hit "OK" and now your posts have categories, too!

# That's all the quick-starting you need!

You now have a fully functional Github-hosted blog! Who said setting up a blog and using Github was a lot of work?

However, if you want to dive a bit deeper, you can start playing with the innards of gh-blog by cloning your fork to your own computer, and checking out the code in a text editor or IDE.

Good places to start are playing around with the styling, in `./gh-weblog/style.css`, or maybe even work on your posts outside of the browser, by editing the files in the `./gh-weblog/contents/posts` directory: `index.json` is the list of posts the blog knows about, and each entry has a file in the `metadata` and `markdown` directories.

What's in them?

Well, open them in a text editor and find out! (spoilers: they're just some things like the title and tags, and your actual post, respectively)
