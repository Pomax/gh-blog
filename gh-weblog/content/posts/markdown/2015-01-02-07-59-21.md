I rewrote [my github-based bloggin platform](http://pomax.github.io/gh-blog) to be easier to maintain (despite having no real desire to need to - if it works, it should just work) as well as easier to have others install and use it. The new version has been implemented as a [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) application, using [marked.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) as the Markdown parser, and [octokit.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/octokit) as the interface to github. Before, posts were rather ugly .json files on github, but the new version makes that `.json` files for the metadata, and `.md` files for the actual posts, so if you want to edit them after you posted them outside of the blog itself, it's now super simple.

I kept the "post processing" concept so that you can add in your own content processors in case just markdown isn't enough, so to prove that this works, my own blog [has some code](https://github.com/Pomax/Pomax.github.io/blob/master/index.html#L32) that adds [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) parsing on top of the base processing. For instance, if I were to write the law of cosines out in LaTex, you'd see:

`\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2 \cdot a \cdot b \cdot cos(Î³) \]`

Mathemagical!

There's also an admin panel now, which has some bits for letting you say (based on your *current browser localStorage*) what your credentials are, as well as an immediate "log out" button. There is no log in server, the code simply assumes you have the right creds filled in, and Octokit will simply fail if it tries to push a commit with the wrong credentials.

[The app code](https://github.com/Pomax/Pomax.github.io/blob/master/index.html#L54) is about as simple as a configurable system based on HTML can get, and you can specify that multiple RSS files need to be generated based on post tags (for instance, in addition to the general [rss.xml](gh-weblog/rss.xml), I need a feed for [Mozilla-only posts](http://pomax.github.io/gh-weblog/mozilla-rss.xml)). I'll be adding a few more things, maybe, like a calendar filter and a "titles only" view, but for the most part this thing is virtually done now, and really just needs packing up.

I tried to figure out how to combine React code with mixins in a way that lets me bundle and [uglify](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs) the whole shebang with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), which [seems to have worked](https://github.com/Pomax/gh-blog/blob/gh-pages/gh-weblog/Gulpfile.js) (although it might be cleaner by using [browserify](http://browserify.org), so that'll be the next step) and hopefully that works well enough for me.

I'll be testing it for a bit, and if it's stable enough I'll be cleaning up the posts over on [the dev repo](https://github.com/Pomax/gh-blog), documenting how you use it (basically a git clone or just .zip unpack and you're done) and then maybe we can get the world blogging even more than it already is.
