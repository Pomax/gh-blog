I'm preparing to extend my [article on Bezier curves](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo) with a "real" section on approximating curves using circular arcs, and in order to do so it is important to know a few things about curves, notably how many inflections it has, and whether there are loops or cusps. The paper ["A Geometrical Characterization of Parametrics Cubic Curves"](http://graphics.pixar.com/people/derose/publications/CubicClassification/paper.pdf) from 1989, by Maureen C. Stone and Tony D. DeRose, offers some solid maths on how to do this, as Bezier curves are invariant under [linear transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map), which means the first three coordinates can be mapped to (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1), leaving only a single point as "free" point.

For instance, the curve on the left in the following image can be turned into a canonical form like on the right (in purplish pink), with three fixed coordinates (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1), and only the last point is "somewhere" (if the point was in the "loop" region, the original curve with would have a loop in it, and several other regions of the graph imply other curve features):

So, how can we make that mapping happen? First, let's translate all our points so that the curve starts at (0,0). This part is easy, and is just subtracting the coordinates of the first point from all points. Not "from all other points", but literally from all points, otherwise the first point won't be on (0,0) of course. I'm going to do this with a clever matrix trick: Instead of considering our coordinates as (x,y) coordinates, I'm going to treat them as (x,y,z) coordinates with `z` fixed to 1, because doing so lets us use [matrix multiplications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication).

## Let's enter the matrix

I know, that movie's from 1999. The important part is where we use a simple matrix that we can multiply coordinates with that moves any coordinate by some fixed distance (dx,dy), an operation called "[translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_%28geometry%29)", and it's actually really easy:

`\[ T_1 =
\left [ \begin{array}
     01 & 0 & -{P_1}_x \\\\
    0 & 1 & -{P_1}_y \\\\
    0 & 0 & 1
  \end{array} \right ]
\cdot
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    x \\\\
    y \\\\
    1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
=
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    1 \cdot x + 0 \cdot y - {P_1}_x \cdot 1 \\\\
    0 \cdot x + 1 \cdot y - {P_1}_y \cdot 1 \\\\
    0 \cdot x + 0 \cdot y + 1 \cdot 1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
=
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    x - {P_1}_x \\\\
    y - {P_1}_y \\\\
    1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
\]`

Running all our coordinates through this transformation gives a new set of coordinates, let's call those `U`, where the first coordinate lies on (0,0), and the rest is still somewhat free. Our next job is to make sure point 2 ends up lying on the `x=0` line, so what we want is a transformation matrix that, when we run it, subtracts `x` from whatever `x` we currently have. This is called "[shearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_matrix)", and the typical x-shear matrix and its transformation looks like this:

`\[
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    1 & ... & 0 \\\\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\\\
    0 & 0 & 1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
\cdot
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    x \\\\
    y \\\\
    1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
=
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    x + ... \cdot y \\\\
    y \\\\
    1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
\]`

So we want some shearing value that, when multiplied by `y`, yields `-x`, so our x coordinate becomes zero. That value is simpy `-x/y`, because `-x/y * y = -x`. Done:

`\[ T_2 =
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    1 & -\frac{{U_2}_x}{{U_2}_y} & 0 \\\\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\\\
    0 & 0 & 1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
\]`

Now, running this on all our points generates a new set of coordinates, let's call those V, which now have point 1 on (0,0) and point 2 on (0, some-value), and we wanted it at (0,1), so we need to [do some scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_%28geometry%29) to make sure it ends up at (0,1). Additionally, we want point 3 to end up on (1,1), so we can also scale x to make sure its x-coordinate will be 1 after we run the transform. That means we'll be x-scaling by 1/point3<sub>x</sub>, and y-scaling by point2<sub>y</sub>. This is really easy:

`\[ T_3 =
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    \frac{1}{{V_3}_x} & 0 & 0 \\\\
    0 & \frac{1}{{V_2}_y} & 0 \\\\
    0 & 0 & 1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
\]`

Then, finally, this generates a new set of coordinates, let's call those W, of which point 1 lies on (0,0), point 2 lies on (0,1), and point three lies on (1, ...) so all that's left is to make sure point 3 ends up at (1,1) - but we can't scale! Point 2 is already in the right place, and y-scaling would move it out of (0,1) again, so our only option is to y-shear point three, just like how we x-sheared point 2 earlier. In this case, we do the same trick, but with `y/x` rather than `x/y` because we're not x-shearing but y-shearing. Additionally, we don't actually want to end up at zero (which is what we did before) so we need to shear towards an offset, in this case 1:

`\[ T_4 =
\left [
  \begin{matrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\\\
    \frac{1 - {W_3}_y}{{W_3}_x} & 1 & 0 \\\\
    0 & 0 & 1
  \end{matrix}
\right ]
\]`

And this generates our final set of four coordinates. Of these, we already know that points 1 through 3 are (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1), and only the last coordinate is "free". In fact, given any four starting coordinates, the resulting "transformation mapped" coordinate will be:

`\[
mapped_4 = \left (
  \begin{matrix}
   x =  \left (
    \frac
    {
      -x_1 + x_4 - \frac{(-x_1+x_2)(-y_1+y_4)}{-y_1+y_2}
    }
    {
      -x_1+x_3-\frac{(-x_1+x_2)(-y_1+y_3)}{-y_1+y_2}
    }
    \right )
\\\\
   y = \left (
    \frac{(-y_1+y_4)}{-y_1+y_2}
    +
    \frac
    {
      \left ( 1 - \frac{-y_1+y_3}{-y_1+y_2} \right )
      \left ( -x_1 + x_4 - \frac{(-x_1+x_2)(-y_1+y_4)}{-y_1+y_2} \right )
    }
    {
      -x_1+x_3-\frac{(-x_1+x_2)(-y_1+y_3)}{-y_1+y_2}
    }
    \right )
  \end{matrix}
\right )
\]`

That looks very complex, but notice that every coordinate value is being offset by the initial translation, and a lot of terms in there repeat: it's pretty easy to calculate this fast, since there's so much we can cache and reuse while we compute this mapped coordinate!

Here's some [Processing](http://processing.org) code for this, for instance:

```
// do the translation first (8 operations)
for(Point p: points) {
  p.x -= p1.x;
  p.y -= p1.y;
}

// computation for transformed x (in just six operations):
float xy2 = p2.x / p2.y;
float xn = p4.x - p4.y * xy2;
float xd = p3.x - p3.y * xy2;
float np4x = xn/xd;

// computation for transformed y (also in just six operations):
float yt1 = p4.y / p2.y;
float yt2 = 1 - p3.y / p2.y;
float yp = yt2 * xn / xd;
float np4y = yt1 + yp;

// done. That wasn't painful in the slightest!
return new Point(np4x, np4y);
```

That's kind of super-simple code, I think you'll agree. It's just a few basic arithmetic statements. Coding math tends to be easier than the formulae make it look!

## Going back by running it in reverse

So... what if we want to move this "transformed" point around? How to we get the amount by which the original point moves? As it turns out, with the matrices we already computed, discovering that is a matter of "reversing the procedure": if we move our mapped point by some distance `(dx,dy)`, then we can simply multiply that moved coordinate by the [inverse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix), and end up with the corresponding change in the original coordinate:

`\[
mapped_4' = mapped_4 + \left(
    \begin{matrix}
      dx \\\\
      dy \\\\
      1
    \end{matrix}
  \right )
\]`

Which we transform back using:

`\[
P_4' =   T_1^{-1} \cdot T_2^{-1} \cdot T_3^{-1} \cdot T_4^{-1} \cdot mapped_4'
\]`

Which we evaluate "in reverse" (because that's how matrices work):

`\[
P_4' =  T_1^{-1} \cdot ( T_2^{-1} \cdot ( T_3^{-1} \cdot ( T_4^{-1} \cdot mapped_4' )))
\]`

And this gives us a surprisingly simple answer:

`\[
P_4' =
\left (
  \begin{matrix}
    -dy \cdot x_1 + (-dx+dy)x_2 + dx \cdot x_3 + x_4)
    \\\\
    -dy \cdot y_1 + (-dx+dy)y_2 + dx \cdot y_3 + y_4)
  \end{matrix}
\right )
\]`

This is even easier to code than the forward transform:

```
return new Point(
   -dy * p1.x + (-dx+dy)*p2.x + dx*p3.x + p4.x,
   -dy * p1.y + (-dx+dy)*p2.y + dx*p3.y + p4.y
);
```
Literally just the maths implemented over two lines of code.

## How the heck did you get all this? Are you a maths genius?

Let me put this as plain as I can: anyone with high school maths skills can do this. Why? One word: [Mathematica](www.wolfram.com/mathematica).

Tracking all this math by hand is insane, and we invented computers, literally, to do this for us. I have no reason to use pen and paper when I can write out what I want to do in a program, and have the program do the math for me. And real math, too, with symbols, not with numbers. In fact, [here's](gh-weblog/downloads/canonical-curve.nb) the Mathematica notebook if you want to see how this works for yourself.

Now, I know, you're thinking "but Mathematica is super expensive!" and that's true, it's [$295 for home use](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica-home-edition), but it's **also** [free when you buy a $35 raspberry pi](http://www.wolfram.com/raspberry-pi). Obviously, I bought a raspberry pi, and I encourage you to do the same. With that, as long as you know what you want to *do*, Mathematica can just do it for you. And we don't have to be geniusses to work out what the maths looks like. That's what we have computers for.
