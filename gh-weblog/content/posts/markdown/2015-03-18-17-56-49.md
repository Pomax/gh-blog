We recently took a trip over to [Mayne Island](http://www.mayneisland.com), one of the Canadian [Gulf Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Islands), to visit a friend and generally enjoy being outdoorsy. Coming back to Vancouver after was actually a little depressing (and Vancouver is *green*), so we'll be going back again next week (hurray!) but in the mean time have some photos from the trip so far:

That's a link to the [Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax/sets/72157649094636613), btw, you probably want to click it for much better (and more) images =)
