My coffee cup broke. Normally, that's hardly a problem and you buy another for $5 and move on with your life, except in this case my "coffee cup" was a large Japanese earthenware "beer mug" and costs $25... do I buy a new one? I can, I have a job, but it seems weird to throw something like that away.

Then I remembered something: [kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi). A Japanese practice of glueing broken pottery back together with laquer, and then dusting the seams with precious metal powder. The result is a mended piece of pottery that both looks very pretty, and will simply live on instead of being thrown away.

So, off to the internet I went to watch some videos on how to perform this art ([David Pike](https://www.youtube.com/user/togeii/videos) has been most instructional, and is almost as soothing as watching [Fushimi Maki](http://www.handmadejapan.com/e_/features_/eft003_01.htm) make a [honkatajiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TPmTYdh8oI&index=1&list=PLB68D28BEA1263D89))) and then hit up Amazon to buy a [kitsugi repair kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H87UH1U). Sure, the kit is $100 and the cup is only $25, but I have at least one more cup that can stand with some mending if this turns out nicely, and then the proposition becomes far less odd.

## Day 1: joining the pieces

So, a short report in pictures:

The cup, unfortunately in pieces, and the kintsugi essentials: a spatula/scraper, plain urushi lacquer, three kinds of metallic powder (silver, pearl gold, and copper), and a bag of tonoko powder, which is a kind of clay. However, following David Pike's experience, I'll be using flour instead of tonoko to create my seaming paste, because flour's much finer, and form clumps.

### step 1: making some paste

<img src="/gh-weblog-2/images/kintsugi/day 1/pate.jpg">

My mixture of flour and laquer, to act as seaming glue, mixed to a consistency of a thick paste (for reference it's only a little less thick than blue tack). It dries while you work with it, but thankfully it dries rather slowly. Also, this was about three times as much as I needed, so hurray for learning!

### step 2: glueing the pieces together

The procedure is mostly a painstaking one, rather than a complicated one: apply paste to the broken sides of all the pieces:

and then simply put everything in place:

The part that makes it painstaking is that the paste likes to stick to itself quite a bit, rather than sticking to the relatively smooth seams, so applying it in a manner that makes it stick properly is a tedious process. Handiworky, so if you enjoy being able to turn off all thought except for the one very specific thing you're doing right now, that then it's entirely enjoyable, but if you don't... you might get bored really quickly.

### step 3: making sure everything's going to set properly

Lacquer is funny in that you can't really speed up the curing process, so your piece needs to be held in place while it cures. In this case, that means liberal application of "fairly loose" elastic bands. The last thing you want is the elastic to pull your pieces into something warped, so you just want enough tension to keep things together, rather than "compressed tightly".

The lacquer will cure, it will get hard, it just takes time.

After having this sit for a few hours, the lacquer gets to be a gummy consistency, which allowed me to clean it up off a little, which in turn makes it easier to sand the seams smooth once everything's dried out properly (although that said, it can take about a week for lacquer to *fully* dry, so the initial 24 hour curing period is really more about "making it possible to work on the piece" rather than "letting it cure until it's done")

### step 3b: making sure the alignment is right while you still can

Pieces are going to shift initially, because the lacquer hasn't starting setting properly yet, and things can still move around under the pressure of you working, and elastic bands. After a few hours, the lacquer will still be pliable without being super shifty, and you can simply push pieces to where they need to be, at least in terms of making sure the interior/exterior surfaces all line up.

For things like cups with ears, the ear becomes a bit of a problem because it's hard to seat that correctly while also maintaining pressure, so you may have to ensure the alignment is "good enough" a few times over the first six hours of curing or so. If you don't get it perfect: there's always post-sanding retouching, but sometimes an imperfect join is part of a piece's appeal.

It's also easier to clean off laquer smears and specks after a few hours than right away, so after sitting for about 12 hours and a little cleaning, the cup looks like this:

Although of course the lacquer is still curing, so we'll cover the next few days in future posts!

Once the lacquer has cured enough to take it, it helps to have it cure under pressure to ensure a strong bond. That's a 5lbs plate on top of the cup for 12 or more hours.
