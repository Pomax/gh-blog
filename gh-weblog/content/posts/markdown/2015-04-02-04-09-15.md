## Day 3 (or 4): recleaning and resanding

After having the cup sit for a longer period of time for the lacquer to cure, and the lacquer's hardened pretty well, we can retry to the whole cleaning and sanding part. Also, in addition to just "time", the cup received a lot more tension in the form of hardcore elastic and string, as well as 7lbs of weight sat on top, to form strong bonds:

So after "unwrapping" the cup, and using a scraper to clean off the new runoff lacquer and specks etc, the results is pretty decent:

And the other side:

The inside of the cup, however, is a different matter. I messed this up. Clearly. I started cleaning too soon, and I used too much cement. and it became a mess.

*But I have a rotary tool.*

So I took that to the inside of the cup with some sanding heads

One rotary sanding later, and things look a little less blarg. I'm not "happy" with this, I really wish I could clean this up better but this cup has one major aspect that makes it near impossible:

The inside of the cup is actually has a coarse, almost porous finish, which makes beer keep micronucleating, meaning it'll always maintain a bit of a head. That's pretty neat! But it also means it's virtually impossible to properly clean.

Of course, then I ran into a snag:

After doing all the recleaning and resanding, it seemed that the ear was, somehow, still a little loose. This frustrated me. A lot.

*So I tore it off.*

And then it turned out that, really, only the outer 2mm of lacquer had set, and every else inside was still most definitely soft lacquer, and that would have never set properly. So: I'll be gilding the cup itself tomorrow. And then the ear will be a separate operation.
