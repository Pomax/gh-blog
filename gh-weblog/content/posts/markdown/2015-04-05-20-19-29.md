This blog relied on fragment ID redirection, using JavaScript, in order to fetch content for individual posts (i.e. you were looking at a single post rather than the main pomax.github.io list of posts). That works, but is also pretty horrible for bookmarks and search engine indexing. The reason I did this was because the blog is hosted as a Github pages CMS, so I can't rely on something like an [.htaccess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.htaccess) file to do redirects sensibly.

[Or can I?](https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages)

Since Github allows you to use custom 404 pages, I can make things point to "nonexistent links" so that they'll hit the 404 page, and then [immediately rewrite the URL](https://github.com/Pomax/gh-blog/blob/develop/404.html#L6-36) to the fragment form I was relying on before.

That alone is not very useful: now we're still stuck with fragment IDs and the original problem is still there... but the content is still dynamically served using JavaScript, and that means there's access to the [browser history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history), which means that once the fragment content loads, the browser [can be told](https://github.com/Pomax/gh-blog/blob/develop/gh-weblog/components/WebLog.jsx#L78-84) what their URL is *supposed* to be, so I can replace the ugly fragment ID with a pretty, human-readable, "real" URL, without any fragment ids.

For instance, say you're navigating to this post. Your browser would try to load http://pomax.github.io/1428265169683/fixing-my-blog-post-urls, which doesn't exist as a true file resource on Github. Instead, you hit the 404 page, which looks at the URL, notices it matches the single-post-form for a URL, and redirects you to the original fragment-based URL, http://pomax.github.io/1428265169683. This causes the site to load content in "singleton mode", loading entry 1428265169683, and the moment the data for that entry has been fetched (so we know it's a real post), the browser is told that this content belongs to the URL you originally looked up, rewriting your URL bar to say you're on http://pomax.github.io/1428265169683/fixing-my-blog-post-urls again.

So, while you might see the browser running through three URLs in rapid succession:

1. http://pomax.github.io/1428265169683/fixing-my-blog-post-urls
2. http://pomax.github.io/#gh-weblog-1428265169683
3. http://pomax.github.io/1428265169683/fixing-my-blog-post-urls

The stable URL that you can reliable bookmark, or search-engine-index, is the normal looking, fragment-less URL. And that's important, because *the web is URLs*.
