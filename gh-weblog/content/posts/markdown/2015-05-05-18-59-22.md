I'm trying to write up a modest, easily accessible, educational and interactive analysis of the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture), and realised that I'm kind of very disappointed at the lack of quick and easy "draw me an interactive tree" libraries for use on the web. Even the ones that are reasonably "simple" rely on SVG and I just don't want to go down that route. So, [I wrote this thing](http://pomax.github.io/css-node-graph) using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and the simplest [JS graph implementation](https://github.com/Pomax/css-node-graph/blob/gh-pages/src/js/graph.js) with the simplest JS [graph reflow algorithm](https://github.com/Pomax/css-node-graph/blob/gh-pages/src/js/algorithms.js), and presto. Useful interactive graphs.

That's just an image, but http://pomax.github.io/css-node-graph lets you play with it. Go and click that link.
