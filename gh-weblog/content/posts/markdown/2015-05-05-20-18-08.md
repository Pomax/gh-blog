I've had a Pulsar Titanium Chronograph watch (matte metal with gold accents) for the last... 15 years. Possibly longer. It's finally on its way out (only the main face still works, and of that, even the date is no longer correct. And the button to change it is broken), and so after two years of thinking "maybe I should buy a new watch", I actually did.

Although what I really got was a [flight computer with a watch underneath it](http://www.amazon.ca/Seiko-SNA411-Flight-Alarm-Chronograph/dp/B00068TJM6).

Now, if you've never heard of a flight computer you might think it's some kind of weird specialised digital computery type thingakajigger, but you would be quite wrong: [flight computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_computer) are the most basic, analog of "these things don't break even if everything else does" slide rule style bits of cardboard or metal, that let you perform a million and one different kind of "computations", and are generally extremely useful if you don't have pen and paper and a calculator at the ready.

My flight computer just looks a little fancier than the one you'd be familiar with if you fly planes (or have ever seen a flight computer before):

You can see the flight computer part of it pretty much all over the face and dial:

Holy crap that's a lot of things! And half the fun is figuring out [how to do the million computations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7ZlWKeA_c8) this relatively simple (but sturdy) piece of metal will let me do.

But, why would I buy this watch at all? Why not just install some apps on my phone? Allow me to explain by showing you a picture of [my phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900):

My phone is for making phone calls, sending text messages, and waking me up in the morning.

It can't really do "apps" (or, it can, but no one makes apps for it because it's ancient), but on the upside has a battery life of a week or longer. The reason I don't have an iPhone or the like is because in my life, there is no point in owning one: I'm always around wifi, with a laptop, or a workstation, even when traveling. And if I need map navigation, cars come with GPS, and public transport kind of never takes accidental wrong turns. The modern phone basically has nothing to offer me. So instead of spending $600 on an iphone, I spent far less on this watch, and will spend the remainder on buying tasty ingredients for cooking up tasty food.

Also this watch is insane. Thank you for reading.
