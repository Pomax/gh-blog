This post is based on the original album over at http://imgur.com/gallery/hQRaL, which after some requests I am reposting here for those who do not visit [imgur.com](http://imgur.com), or feel uncomfortable linking people to imgur albums. This article covers the process of making traditional baguettes from start to finish using a high hydration dough (69.5%), and cold fermentation.

## Let's make this:

<img src="/images/baguette/bread.jpg" alt="Traditional french bread">

(or at least, let's make the bread part. This post is not about how to make pepper pâté, salame calabrese, or firm cheese)

We'll be making "pain de Tradition Française", traditional French bread; specifically, something the French would call ["baguette de campagne"](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=baguette%20de%20campagne&tbs=imgo:1), not to be confused with ["pain de campagne"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_de_campagne), which is a rather different bread.

Now, "traditional" in French baking is not about a bread being "rustic" or "artisinal", it is a technical term that indicates that it has been made using only the four permitted ingredients for traditional breads: flour, water, plain salt, and yeast.



The approach we're taking here uses an extremely high hydration dough (almost 70%) and takes about an hour to make, over 2 days: we'll need about 15 minutes on day 1 to make the initial dough, which then undergoes cold fermentation (also called retarded fermentation, or delayed fermentation) in the fridge overnight, and then the next morning (or afternoon depending on how much you like to sleep in) we need about 15 minutes in the morning to prep loaves, then a 2 hour period of doing nothing while the dough rises, and then 20~30 minutes to bake the loaves into tasty, tasty bread.

Also, not unimportant to know, with the measurements used in this post we will be making four baguettes of around 280g each. We will be using:

- 680 grams of all purpose flour, acting as our 100% weight metric. I use [Robin Hood all purpose flour](http://www.robinhood.ca/Products/All-Purpose-Flours/Original-All-Purpose-Flour), which is a great flour for making baguettes because it has a high protein content (around 12%), which is important if we want enough gluten formation to get good oven spring.
- 69.5% water (473 grams)
- 1.2% plain table salt (a smidge over 8 grams)
- 0.45% active dry yeast (3 grams)

This will yield four baguettes, weighing in at  280 to 290 gram each.

## Day 1: making dough (15m)

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-01.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

We start with 340 grams of flour, which is about 3 cups, but not every cup of flour weighs the same, so let's go with weight measurements.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-02.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

To the flour we add about 3/4th of a tablespoon of salt, which is somewhere between 8 and 9 grams (it's hard to weigh salt if your scales only do 1 gram increments). Make sure to mix this in a little, instead of just sprinkling it on top.

Also note we really do want plain salt. If your salt has an "ingredients" list, and it contains more than "sodium chloride", like preservatives, or potassium chloride (known in Europe as Kalium Chloride, KaCl), we don't want to use that. Thankfully, pure table salt is stupidly easy to come by, and any supermarket will sell 2kg boxes of the stuff for under $10, which will last you years.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-03.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

In terms of water, we're adding two cups: 470 grams (473 if you want to be super technical)

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-04.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

next up: yeast. 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast, or about 3 grams. We want to dissolve this in the water before doing any mixing. It'll take a bit to dissolve properly: if we don't wait long enough, there will be some undissolved sludge left after we pour out the water. We want that sludge in the dough, not stuck to the bottom of our measuring cup.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-05.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Once the yeast's dissolved, we add all the yeasty water to the flour and salt mixture, and create what can only be properly described as "a slurry".

We then mix this at a super low speed. I use a [Kitchenaid "Professional 550 Heavy Duty"](http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/KitchenAid-KV25MEX-5.5-quart-Pro-550-Plus-Heavy-Duty-Stand-Mixer/8264907/product.html) set to 2-out-of-10, which is about the lowest you can meaningfully get, but if you're using a hand mixer, set it to the lowest speed. We want to mix the dough, not beat it.

At low speed, we can basically mix for as long as we like without overworking the dough, which is important. Mixing too fast can literally destroy it.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-06.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

While the mixer's running, we'll be adding another 340 grams (~3 cups) of flour to progressively work up the dough. We don't dump it all in at once because it'll take much longer to mix evenly, so the pictures above are after adding one cup at a time and waiting for most of the flour to be absorbed before adding the next cup.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-07.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

Once all the flour's been absorbed into the dough, the dough's not actually fully mixed yet. It'll look ragged and tear because not all the flour's hydrated, so let it run for another minute or two and it should turn into a smooth, almost paste-like consistency. It might also look "too sticky" in places (especially at the bottom, where it might look like it's terminally sludge-stuck to the bowl). Don't worry: just let the mixing do its thing for 2 minutes, the dough will homogenise. That's what mixing does.

Science time: when you add flour, two things happen. First, the flour is simply mixed into the dough. While that happens, the overall water content of the dough stays the same: despite having added some flour, the dough will seem just as sticky as before. The trick is that we need to wait for water to redistribute itself from "the sticky dough" to also covering the not-yet-fully-coated-in-water individual particles of flour that we just added.

However, this process can take a minute, and that's why we'll be adding small amounts of flour at a time: if we don't wait long enough, we'll be deciding whether to add more flour while the dough's still firming up. While it might initially look right, once all the flour particles hydrate the dough will end up firmer than is desirable for this particular bread recipe.

So with that in mind: if after a few more minutes of mixing the dough still looks too sticky, take a quarter cup of flour, sprinkle half of that in, with the mixer on, and wait a minute. You typically only need very little to make the dough go from "sticky" to "tacky but not actually sticky", so add tiny bits of flour, let it mix in properly (not just get absorbed by the dough), and then see if the dough comes off the bowl at the bottom while mixing. If it doesn't: repeat. If it does: we're done.

Taking the resulting dough out of the bowl (with clean, dry hands) and balling it up with two hands should now feel tacky, without actually leaving any of it sticking to your hands.

## Night 1: Low temperature fermentation

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-08.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

After balling up the dough, it goes into the fridge (with a pot lid as cover - they're all standard sizes, so one of your covers is bound to fit your bowl!) for a very slow, flavour developing fermentation. Note that we're not using any oil or spray to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl. For one, oil is not used at any point in the traditional baguette process, but more importantly, if the bowl is smooth, then the dough we've just made is simply not going to stick to it. When we take it out tomorrow, it'll come out all on its own.

I typically make this dough around noon, and then around 10pm it'll have double in size. At this stage, I take the dough out, punch it down (taking it out of the bowl and start balling it up tightly again, so all the built up gas escapes) and then it goes back into the fridge until the morning. Normally, a fresh dough like this needs maybe two hours at room temperature to double in volume. In the fridge, it takes about 10.

It is possible that the dough doesn't seem to rise at all in the fridge. Rather than blaming the yeast for being dead, it is entirely possible that the fridge is cold enough for the yeast to just not "get going". In this case, we can leave the dough out of the fridge until it doubles in size, so that we know the yeast's fully activated, then punch it down and put it in the fridge. Have a look at it before going to bed, at which point it'll probably need the punching down as just described, before further developing overnight.

## Day 2: initial shaping (15m)

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-09.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

When we take the dough out in the morning, it'll have doubled again.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-10.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

So, again, we punch it down to its original size.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-11.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Now we start on a 15ish minute adventure of turning the ball of dough into loaves that we will set aside to proof for an hour or two.

Take that dough and put it on a work surface.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-12.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Cut it up into four pieces of equal weight, and ball them up. I've covered them with a bit of flour here to make sure they don't stick (as the dough warms back it, it becomes a bit stickier), and the excess flour from that gets moved off to a little pile on the corner of my worksurface, and gets used as necessary in the next step.

With the measurements used, each piece'll be around 275 grams. That's 25 grams more than "real" baguette is allowed to be, but we're not selling this bread in France, and so the French laws around baguette do not apply in our house.

Also: yes, seriously. France has laws in place to guarantee certain properties of traditional bread. Enjoy some http://www.cooksinfo.com/french-bread-law-1993

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-13.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

Then we roll out the dough to about 30cm (12") sausages.

Rather than doing one piece and then moving on to the next, we roll each of them a little bit, place them aside, and then roll the next one. We do this because it gives the dough a chance to "relax" between rolls, which means you are less likely to roll the dough such that there is a huge air pocket in the middle of the dough (affectionately, as well as pejoratively, called the hole "where the baker sleeps").

We basically put a ball of dough high up on the work surface, and with two hands cupped over the dough, roll our hands down over the dough, pulling it down across the work surface as we roll.

This pretty much automatically starts turning our balls of dough into a fat torpedo shape after a few rolls. Once we get to stage 2, you can roll down the dough with your fingers together at the top, and then gently spreading them as you roll down, to make the dough stretch.

We're not aiming for speed here. I tend to do three rolls down per piece for each stage, but if you need more: go for it.

If you need fewer: you're going too fast. The dough hasn't developed to a point where it'll take the kind of forces your subjecting it to, which will make it tear internally, so slow down.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-14.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

After the third stage we need to give the loaves one more roll-down, leaving the ends "as is", with a little more pressure in the center, to make them roughly uniform-girth sausages.

Also, a simple trick: I like to rise my dough on parchment ("baking") paper, rather than a silicon pad, or a "baguette proofing rack" or even a couche (basically a progressive-flour-impregnated-as-it-is-used heavy linnen or burlap cloth) because it lets me use the parchment for two purposes.

The first is to obviously just proof the dough without having it stick to *everything*. if I cut the paper to about 45cm (18") length, I can easily fold it such that will accommodate the dough as it proofs, without sticking together even all the way at the end.

Secondly, I can reuse that parchment for loading the loaves into the oven: when the dough is done, we're going to take it off the parchment, stretch it to 45cm, after which we can put the loaves back on the unfolded parchment lengthwise. Very handy.

(And extremely important: do NOT use wax paper. Yes, it's non-stick, but it also catches fire in a hot oven. Because it's coated in wax/parrafin. The stuff generic candles are made of. And yes, I did make that mistake once, a long time ago. Once is all you need)

A small sidenote here for the American audience: you might be familiar with the "[baguette mold](http://www.amazon.com/Perforated-Aluminum-French-Baguette-Bread/dp/B0015QPYQ8)", and as handy as they sound, they have no place, whatsoever, at all, in the traditional baguette baking process. Traditional baguette are hearth baked, and that means the loaves sit directly on the stone. The most traditional way to do things here is to use a couche for proofing the dough, and then transferring them directly onto the hearth deck for baking. However, in the interest of practicality, using parchment for both steps is the least offensive (as in "it is an offense to do this") alternative.

Also, your loaves may not all be the same length. As long as the difference is about an inch, don't worry about it. The important part is that the dough will proof in roughly the right shape, after which we're going to reshape the loaves, so a little variation in size at this point is going to be completely undone by the time we get ready for baking.

## Proofing to dough: (roughly 2h)

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-15.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

There are many, many, *many* ways to proof dough, but I like precision, so I spent some money to get that: this is a generic roasting pan that also happens to work really well as a proofing pan, sitting on top of a heat mat intended for seeding vegetables and potting plants ([$40 for a 20"x20" mat](http://www.amazon.com/Hydrofarm-MT10008--20-Inch-Seedling-Heat/dp/B000E3DDP2)), hooked up to a [simple thermostat](http://www.amazon.com/Hydrofarm-MTPRTC-Digital-Thermostat-Heat/dp/B000NZZG3S) ($30). This mat can't really get all that hot, but the temperature range it produces is specific to germinating seeds, and the temperatures that are good for germinating seeds are exactly the same temperatures that are good for germinating yeast.

A cheaper option is to proof your bread in your oven with the oven light on (provided it's incandescent and not LED) because that creates an above-room-temperature environment without getting overly hot.

Basically: go with what works - my solution lets me say "proof at 35C" and then walk away for a while without needing to check whether it's doing what I'm hoping it's doing.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-16.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

Let's enjoy the magic of time: on the left are the loaves that we got after rolling them into fat sauasages, before we start proofing. The middle shows the loaves after an hour (at which point we probably need to turn on the oven) and after another 45 minutes, we get the fat doughsplosions on the right.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-17.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

If you're wonding why we need to turn on the oven 45 minutes before we actually start baking: we're actually turning it on about an hour before we start baking. Because it's going to take a long time to heat up properly: we're going to hearthbake.

That's a fancy word for "baking using stones". And I recommend getting a pizza stone because never buy something that can only be used for one thing. A pizza stone is super handy to have for many reasons, one of which is that it lets us bake proper baguettes (another obvious use is baking delicious thin crust pizze).

The one in this picture is a [Pizzacraft](http://www.pizzacraft.com) [20"x13.5"x1" stone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IF2YOW) ($30 when on sale), and that much stone takes a while to heat to 280C (~550F). That's right: we're baking these breads in a very hot oven.

Also, because your oven will lie to you about how hot it is, put a $5 oven thermometer on the stone so it can register the temperature just above the stone, instead. Your oven may say it's done heating up to 280C, but the stone might still only be 190C. If we were to bake at those temperatures, the bread will die a very sad death in the oven. Alternatively, if you have one, use a laser thermometer for even more accurate information on how hot your stone is.

## Final shaping (10m)

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-18.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

After our 1 hour 45 of proofing, now comes the tricky part: getting the dough off the parchment. You could have, in theory, sprayed the parchment with some oil so that the dough doesn't get stuck at all, but again: we're making traditional French bread, not [focaccia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focaccia) or pizza dough, and oil is not part of the process.

My approach is to simply dust the loaves with flour after taking them out of the proofing box and then, using a flat scraper, starting from the sides, use short "scrapes" to get the scraper to underneath the loaf from the side, lift it up a little, and pull the scraper back. Gently repeat this up and down the loaf and it'll detach from the paper fairly quickly. Once losse, we can roll them off onto our work surface by simply lifting the paper between loaves.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-18b.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

In the above picture, you can see the parchment showing signs of scaping to the right, along the sides of the first loaf, with the second image showing the same process for the second loaf, after the first fully separated and got "rolled" off the parchement, resting upside down on the work surface.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-19.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Of course, we do this four times... and while doing this, you'll notice that the dough is now *incredibly* supple and elastic, which is good: that's exactly what we need, because it'll make the dough "spring" in the oven beautifully.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-20.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

To make the album-poster-bread up top, we now "fold" each loaf, by taking the sides, gently pulling them towards each other over the center, and pinching them so they stick together. This makes the loaves a little less wide, but will make them look rather pretty: after pinch-folding, flip them over back onto the parchment, making sure they stretch the length of the parchment.

You may get some pretty damn big bubbles while doing this, and if you're worried about those: it's perfectly okay to pop them. The middle image shows the loaf after it's been pinch-folded along the bottom, with bubbles developing, and on the right, post-surgery where I popped the obvious ones back into place with a sharp knife point.

BUT: what if we skip this step? What if we just bake the soft and springy dough without pinch-folding it up on itself? Well... let's just say the result is bread, but it's bread with issues. After we finish up with the procedure for the bread up top, we'll look at what happens if we don't pinch-fold the dough. Be warned though: the result is pretty bad.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-21.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

Placing the dough back on the parchment can seem tricky: because the dough's super elastic by now, they might stretch "too far", being too long for the parchment, but don't worry!

The dough's super-tolerant right now (unlike when we were rolling it earlier, before proofing) so we can simply "force" it to a roughly straight, parchment-fitting length, and give it a minute or two to rest. The dough's elastic nature will make it pull itself back together, to the point where most wrinkles will be virtually straight surface again.

We also want to make sure our loaves don't dry out, so use a spray bottle (with water) and mist the loaves a little so they don't dry out too much: it may be a high-hydration dough, but any drying we can prevent, is drying we should prevent. Once we've done all loaves, give them another mist and let them rest for a few minutes so they can all recover. And then once they no longer look super wrinkly we can move on to baking our bread!

Also a fun fact: we're not really making true baguette, which is typically 65cm long and must weight 250 grams, but we're also not making its thinner cousin, the ficelle, which is about 32cm long and must weigh 100 grams. We're making something in between, longer and wider than a ficelle, more narrow than a baguette, but also a little heavier than a baguette.

If we were running a boulangerie in France, we would not be able to sell what we're making here as baguette, ficelle, or even as flûte. We'd have to come up with a new name.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-22.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

Before loading the loaves in the oven, they need "scoring", in which we tactically cut into the dough so that when it goes into the oven it can expand in a controlled fashion, rather than by breaking through the crust haphazardly as it's forming.

Dust the tops with flour, and then with a very sharp knife, cut across the bread as per the image on the right.

Let me emphasize that: use a _very_ sharp knife.

Or use a [lame](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/lame-bread-slashing-tool) (roughly pronounced "lah-may", because it's French) which is a handle onto which you fit a disposable razor blade. However, I don't use single-use tools, and I don't shave with disposable blades, so I don't own a lame. I use a super sharp knife instead.

Also: it's easy to cut "too deep", but the dough's also very relaxed atm, so if you just cut across the surface without any real pressure behind the cut, you should get decent scoring.

If we make a mistake, we want to much rather cut too shallow than too deep. Why? If we score too deep, the bread will basically "deflate" before we can bake it, and it'll never rise. It'll come out terrible and will pretty much only be usable for bread pudding, if that. However, if we cut too shallow, the bread will find the weakest parts of the crust and literally burst at those seams as the heat of the oven forces it to expand. This will look gnarly, but is infinitely better than scoring too deep, because the bread itself is probably still going to be edible, and is quite likely even tasty. It'll just look really weird.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-23.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Remember when I said to use a sharp knife? This is my solution: a $10 "speedy sharp" carbide sharpener and a 5" utility knife, both last considerably longer than disposable razors on a plastic handle. And no, you should not use a carbide sharpener as a regular sharpener, because it'll wreck your knives, but to maximise an edge with two or three strokes on an otherwise already sharpened knife, it's perfect.

Before scoring, I give the utility knife a quick sharpening, after which it'll slice through dough, even a wet dough like this one, like it's not even there.


## Baking (20m-25m)

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-24.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Finally, we can bake! Open the oven, remove the thermometer (yes, that's speaking from experience), load the breads onto the stone, and close the oven back up.

Let the bread bake at 280C this way for 5 minutes. It needs a few minutes to "spring" into a shape that will let us pummel it with French baking tradition.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-25.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

This is "sprung" dough: after those 5 minutes, no real baking has happened yet (despite the fact that it's been subjected to a constant 280C worth of heat), but the dough got hot enough, fast enough, for the gas trapped inside the dough to expand while the dough around it started hardening fast enough to trap the gas.

Have a look at those score lines: whereas initially they were only separated a few millimeters before loading, after those 5 minutes of spring, they're massive! In fact, we're seeing that we could have probably cut a little deeper: the bread tried to expand more than the scores allowed for, and they "bubbled" a little.

Now comes the fun part: steam.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-26.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Steam is essential for proper crust development. Professional ovens have steam injection; we have a cup of water, instead.

A warning up front: water is dangerous around hot glass. It can crack it, it can explode it, it's not a safe combination, so remember that in the following step:

After the initial 5 minutes of spring time, open the oven door, quickly throw half a cup of water against the left side of the oven, and half a cup against the right side of the oven, and close the door again.

This creates a near instant blast of steam and we'll be leaving the bread to steam-bake for 5 minutes.

Now for the additional disclaimers: obviously, don't throw the water on glass. If you have a glass-covered light in your oven, don't throw the water directly on that. Having the steam hit it is fine, just don't hit the glass itself with the water.

Also, if you've never done this before, you might micro-damage your oven, because we're going to be shocking the inner walls and that might lead to interesting things like enamel powder getting released during the shocking. You don't want that on your bread.

I've done this to my ovens often enough to not even give it a second thought (and I'll break in a new oven by running it through this procedure a few times until I'm sure there's no material ejection due to shocking), but if you're not, another option is to have a metal pan at the base of the oven, and pouring the water in that, rather than throwing it against the walls. It'll probably warp the pan, so make sure it's cheap and not a pan you actually care about, but your oven will stay pristine.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-27.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

After steam baking for five minutes, we open the door to let out the steam.

**STAND BEHIND, NOT OVER, THE DOOR WHEN YOU DO THIS: STEAM IS HOT**

I know, I know, you're thinking "yeah but it's only 100C, because water boils at 100C" and that is not how steam works.

Science time: liquid H₂O ("water") is liquid because of [hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond), which break down at 100C (at 1 atmosphere pressure), turning the water into steam.

Once evaporated into steam, the now completely free H₂O molecules can reach arbitrary temperatures. In fact, they'll comfortably reach 3000C (5430F) before steam breaks down into [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29), so: steam in an oven set to any temperature above 100C will simply be as hot as the oven can make it. In this case, we're baking at about 280C, so by opening the oven door, you're releasing an invisible cloud of _incredibly hot_ steam, and you don't want to stand in the cloud when you release it.

While, on the upside, it'll cool down in less than a second, you still don't want to be the first thing the steam hits: all that energy has to go somewhere, and you don't want to be the thing that receives it. If you are: you'll heal, don't worry about that part, but you'll have a bad time until then (and yes, that's again speaking from experience).

Once the steam's been let out, close the oven door, turn the temperature down to 230C (445F) and leave the bread to bake for 10 minutes.

This is also the point where I typically remove the parchment paper, because from here on out things are going to be hotter than parchment paper can deal with, and the bread's set enough to slide off the parchment without deforming.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-28.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

If your oven seems to bake a little uneven, reorder the bread after 5 minutes. Mine bakes a little hot at the back, so I reorder the loaves such that they're reordered to least-baked-looking at the back (with the least baked side facing the back), most-baked-looking at the front (with the most baked side facing the door).

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-29.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

After the 10 minutes of regular baking, the result is this!

That looks pretty good! But this isn't a true hearth oven, and I find that the sides of my bread don't build up as well as in a true hearth oven (with heating coming from all directions, rather than just from below).

Thankfully, there's a really simple way to deal with this.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-30.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Turn off the oven, flip the bread over, and pop it back into the oven. The pizza stone will still be hot enough, but the ambient temperature will plummet, letting us send heat specifically up into the top and sides of the bread. I tend to do this for five minutes because it just yields a nicer bread.


## After baking (30m minimum)

Once baked, the bread is not done. Science teaches us that at this point, the dough inside the bread is technically gelatinised. It absolutely, positively, NEEDS to cool down before we can eat this bread, tempting as the bread smells. If you were to cut into it right now, it'd taste bad, and feel rubbery.

So: cool the bread on a wire rack, and give it at least half an hour.

Also, this is when we get our first indication of whether we succeeded: we can listen for crackle! (aside from actually eating the bread, this is my favourite part of baking traditional French bread!)

Since the crust will contract as it cools, and because it has nowhere to go, the resulting contractions will actually (micro) fracture the crust, and every fracture comes with an audible crackle. A good crust will audibly crackle (lots!) while it's cooling.

If we don't hear crackling, we should be worried: we may have baked at too low a temperature, or we may not have used enough steam, or we may not have radiated the top enough at the end.

A quick look at the result of our scoring: that's some mighty fine expansion we got there.

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-33.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

So, let's look at the "crumb", which is bread jargon for the texture of the inside of the bread.

Once the bread's cooled at least half an hour, we slice it up to see what it looks like on the inside, and we slice it parallel to the scores, because that gives us nice long slices of bread.

Remember: just because the bread itself isn't wide, doesn't mean we can't get nice long slices from a loaf!

Now, the last thing we want is the kind of "dense, white bread texture" that you find in many a restaurant. If we see that, then the dough didn't develop properly or we worked it too much, compacting it and releasing too much gas.

Instead, we want a good mix of fine, medium, and the occasional large hole.

This will do! Now, finally, we can put some toppings on that and pig out on freshly baked traditional French bread.

And if you want to go over all these steps in a more structured, textual form, you can find those over at https://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax/19938891750, which lends itself better to the "single picture and a wall of text" format, but of course without all photos that follow the process of making traditional French bread.


## What if we don't want to eat all the bread right away?

<img src="/images/baguette/bread-35.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Of course, you might be thinking "But wait, I don't have anywhere to keep these fresh..." but you might be wrong!

Due to its crustiness, this kind of bread will keep perfectly fine for a day or two simply loosely wrapped in paper. See that picture? That's brown shipping paper that you get for free from Amazon because they use yards and yards of that stuff as packing padding.

Done!

The reason paper is so great is that it doesn't trap moisture like plastic or a sealed container, so the crust doesn't getting soggy (on on hot summer days, mold!), but it also doesn't release moisture so fast the bread completely dries out, it takes it a day or two, which is exactly long enough to eat all that bread.

Of course, the bread will lose some of its distinct crunchiness the next day, but we can bring that right back with this guy:

The humble spray bottle.

Take a loaf of next-day-bread, hold it up by its tip and spray the entire loaf, front, back, sides, up and down, then pop it in the oven, set it to 180C, and have it warm back up for 5 to 10 minutes. This crisps the crust right back up, and gives you nice warm bread to munch on.

Don't have a spray bottle? They're dirt cheap, but we can be cheaper and just use our kitchen sink: turn on the tap , and quickly run the whole length of the bread underneath it one way, flip, and run back the other way. Obviously the "quickly" is key here, we don't want to soak the bread, but we do want the entire crust wet. Then we pop it into the oven.

Science time: what happens is that the water soaks into the top layer of the bread, doing two things: acting as a heat shield for the inside of the bread (since the water has to evaporate off before more intense heat makes it into the bread past the crust) and acting as a smoothing agent for the cracked crust, effectively rebuilding it by turning it into something that is almost like a dough again.

After 10 minutes at 180C, the water will have evaporated off and the crust will have hardened back up, while the inside of the bread got just warm enough to be lovely, but not piping hot.

When it comes to traditional French bread, second day bread can be just as good as fresh bread! (although that said, most people in France will just throw the bread out. Or use it as an ingredient for a dish that requires day-old bread, like bread pudding, or crostini)

## So, what if we hadn't pinch-folded the dough?

<img src="/images/baguette/unshaped-01.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Remember when we asked "but what happens if we don't pinch-fold the dough?"... let's examine that idea, because things would have turned out a little differently.

For one, 69.5% hydration is too high for an unfolded loaf, and the dough doesn't really know where to spring to. The scores settle too quickly, so the loaves don't look very nice, and the large holes that formed during proofing stay pretty damn large. We had to poke a few holes during pinch-folding, and it was a good thing we did.

<img src="/images/baguette/unshaped-04.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Big holes in the dough mean even bigger pockets of hot air at the surface of the bread as it bakes, which means that there isn't anything to act as a heat bufffer for the crust over an air pocket, and so the bread will bake very uneven: where there's dough, things'll generally be fine, but if there's a bubble, that section will bake much faster than the rest of the bread, leading to charred sections on an otherwise potentially decent bread.

See if you can count the number of air pockets in just this section of one of the breads baked without pinch-folding.

<img src="/images/baguette/unshaped-02.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 500px" alt="">

Now, those huge pockets of air also make it much harder to use the bread "as bread". It might work well with a bowl of olive oil, but that's about it: the holes are just too big to make the bread of any practical use beyond "dipping bread".

This is particularly obvious in the next close up picture.

<img src="/images/baguette/unshaped-03.jpg" style="max-height:500px; max-width: 100%" alt="">

As you can see, this isn't so much "bread" anymore as "slices of bready colander". Toppings are literally just going to fall through our slices.

So: pinch-folding. It's a good thing.
