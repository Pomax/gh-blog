I've been promising to write this blog post for a while after joking about how the fair number of knives I use in the kitchen would probably fill an entire blog post, but for reasons that have been lost to time never got to it. That changes now.

I like working in the kitchen, I started as a kid, kept it up as a student, and had the pleasure to have access to a good kitchen with gas range after moving to Canada from the Netherlands. When it came time to buy our own house, we specifically bought one with a large kitchen and gas range, and I still get my cook on on a daily -if not more- basis.

Now, cookery requires ingredients, and ingredients quite often require cutting, so you buy a cheap knife set, you use two or three of them frequently, and you can get by quite well. The price of a knife set does not determine how well the knives will work, and some of the more expensive ones (I'm looking at you, Global) are absolutely terrible to have to work with on a daily basis. Better to get a cheap set that cuts well and have a friend grind down the handle a bit where the metal bits and wooden bits don't quite line up, than to pay ten times as much or more for great quality that's horrible to work with.

Now, two or three knives is literally all you need. If I were caught in a situation where I had to prepare food for 40 people and all I had was a chef knife and a paring knife, I'd be fine. But they do make specialty knives, and having them makes certain tasks either more fun, or much easier, so I've picked up a few knives over the years and of those, this blog post will highlight the ones I use regularly, meaning either daily, or at least several times a month. Except for two, but we'll get to them.

Let's talk about this collection, shall we?

## The chef knife
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-02.jpg)

The chef knife is, as far as I'm concerned, the absolute minimum necessary to "do everything". It can slice, it can dice (well, with your help), it can chop, it can pare (while a little inconveniently, it absolutely can), it can fillet, it can crush, as far as I'm concerned it is the only knife you **need** in a kitchen. Although that doesn't mean you should use it for all those things because you'll probably have at least one or two knives that can do one or more of those things better. 

I have a few chef knives, but these are the two I use on a daily basis. The top is essentially my backup for when more than one person's in the kitchen, if it's just me I'll typically use... well, perhaps the level of wear will give it away: I use the knife with the broken tip. It's from a $30 knife set I bought over 10 years ago, and is as sharp as any $200 knife. In terms of actual weight, it's fairly heavy, but it's extremely well balanced so it feels like it has very little true weight to it, and it dances around in your hand if you want it to. Yes, that's the level of satisfaction a nice kitchen knife can give 

I use these for big cuts, slicing, as well as chopping up things. Bog standard use really.

## The utility knife
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-03.jpg)

The utility knife is for smaller jobs. The blade's too short for most things a chef knife is good for, but it's great for incisions and stripping (both of those apply to vegetables as much as to meats).

## The paring knife
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-04.jpg)

A paring knife is the scalpel of the basic set. It's not good for any kind of slicing, but it's great for precision cuts, and cutting things away from each other with minimum spill-over, or creating small cutouts (like taking a stem out of a bell pepper. No need to waste tasty vegetable goodness by cutting off the entire top). 

## A nice sharp cleaver
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-05.jpg)

While this looks like a super heavy thing, and it's certainly heavier than a regular knife, this old Solingen cleaver is essentially the same as a thick Chinese cleaver. It has a sharp edge, and can be used for cutting, chopping, and because of the geometry of the blade near the handle, shucking oysters or other shellfish. And, of course, it's a cleaver so you can use it to cleave, although it's mostly for cleaving *soft* things.

Simple rule: things with sharp edges are meant for cutting, not hitting. The value in a cleaver is its size and solidity; do the initial cut, drive the cleaver in, then drive it through. The softer the thing you're cleaving, the more you can "chop" rather than drive, but this is not TV, and you don't wield a regular cleaver like it's a hatchet.   

For instance: chunking up Chinese barbecue pork: yes. cleaving through a lamb shoulder: no. Splitting a squash: absolutely. Chopping a chicken thigh in half: ... kind of not, no. I mean, you can if you absolutely have to, but really you want the next item on this list instead.


## A nice not-really-sharp bone cleaver
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-06.jpg)

This is a real cleaver in the sense of "what people think of when you say cleaver". It basically a kitchen axe with a relatively dull edge. You don't cut things with this (you plain old can't) but you use it as a splitter to get through bones. Or, sometimes, things that have frozen up pretty solid. 

Unlike a sharp cleaver, bone cleavers *are* wielded like hatchets: it's pretty much what they are. I obviously don't use this every day, it's a specialty knife (if we can really still call it a knife) but this is the only tool I want to use when I do need to use it.

## A yanagi (sashimi) knife
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-07.jpg)

"Japanese knives!", aye. The yanagi knife is a sashimi knife, meaning it's intended for single cut, precision-slicing. It might look a bit long, but honestly I'm looking into replacing it with a longer version: sashimi is raw, which means nothing will have been done to the cut to hide imprecisions or imperfections, and the human tongue is an amazing organ: it will detect rough cuts. The longer the knife, the longer you can make a single, constant pressure cut, which means the cut surface will be absolutely smooth. Unlike a chef knife, where you're often cutting away from yourself, you cut towards yourself with a sashimi knife. Ever seen or bowed a violin? It's pretty much like that. Very little pressure, let the knife do the cutting as you pull it in.

![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-08.jpg)

Unlike the previous knives, this is a single sided knife: it's perfectly flat on the left side, and ground to an extremely sharp edge on the other. At least for sashimi, this means you don't disturb half the cut by "pushing it out of the way", which a "normal" double sided knife will do.

## A deba fish knife
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-09.jpg)

Fish knife! This is a thick, heavy knife with a single sided edge. It's extremely sharp, and great for deboning fish. If you have an whole salmon (and I live in Vancouver, a whole salmon can be yours for about $10) then this knife is all you need to turn it into two beautiful full length fillets.

## An usuba vegetable knife
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-10.jpg)

Finally, the Japanese vegetable knife. Again, single sided edge, and it's incredibly sharp. It sits at the intersection of chef knife and cleaver, and is great for splitting not-too-hard vegetables, as well as chopping up vegetables if presentation is going to matter, like uniformly hair-fine julienne, peeling a cucumber to get the entire skin as a single sheet, getting wafer thin slices of vegetable, et cetera.

I love this knife to bits. 

## The ol' bread knife
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-15.jpg)

On to pure utility: the bread knife. Some people don't have one, some do but never use it, in our household this thing is pretty much used on a daily basis. It's not actually all that good at slicing bread, but it's a great knife for cutting frozen items, as well as "opening up" a bread for slicing, which basically means cutting it in half so that the next knife on the list can be used...

## A bread saw
![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-11.jpg)

That's right, it's a saw. On a handle. For slicing bread. After you open up a bread with the regular breadknife, all the other slices are simply "put this on bread so that the wood touches the side and the saw touches the top. Saw off slice". It is perfect.

![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-12.jpg)

It's also literally just a saw blade. I stopped counting the number of times I accidentally cut myself on this thing. Most knives don't draw blood just by being tapped. This thing? No mercy.

## Keeping knives sharp

And let's not forget the things we need to make sure knives stay usable. Knife edges wear off over time and with use, and hard as metal is, a very sharp blade is thin, and can easily dent or chip. To deal with this, there's three tools in my kitchen for making sure the knives stay usable. 

### a good steel

![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-14.jpg)

First off, a good steel. Steels are not for sharpening a knife, they're for making sure any dents in the cutting edge are smoothed out by "steeling" it: rubbing the edge along the steel, doing both sides to make sure dents in either direction and smoothed back in line with the rest of the edge. Do this when you're done with your knife after cutting something that offered a bit of resistance and your knife'll last a bit longer. 

### grind stone(s) and carbide shaver 

![](/gh-weblog-2/images/knives/knives-13.jpg)

Of course, steeling isn't sharpening, and your knife *will* lose its edge eventually. When that happens, it's time to whip out the grinding stones. I have a combination 400 grit/2000 grit whetstone, and badly dulled knives first get a treatment at 400 before moving on to 2000.

Finally there's that little "speedy sharp" thing: that's a carbide steel strip on a handle. A word of warning: this is *not* a sharpener. This is a shaver, and does what that word implies: the carbide steel strip is much, much stronger than the metal used to make  your knife, and running this across the cutting edge literally shaves off some of the metal. It's a very fast way to give a knife a quick edge, but you've just reduced your knife width by far more than you would if you used a sharpening stone. Use this as your only method of sharpening and you're literally going to just run out of knife. That said, I use this to quickly strip a knife of whatever oxidation or environmental coating it may have picked up when I bake baguettes, where getting a good scoring across the loaves before the bread goes into the oven is far more important to me than wearing out a knife. Just stroke the edge with minimal force a few times and you're good to go. As long as you remember to also give the knife a quick rinse because again: you're shaving it. There will be residue.   

# And that's it.

That's all the knives I use regularly enough to feel they warrant mention - Notably missing are my Chinese cleaves (#1, #2, and #5) that I basically stopped using because between the chef knives and Japanese knives, there's nothing they're actually better at, and while nifty, things like grapefruit knives are so special purpose that if you need them, you know why, and if you don't know why, you won't need them.
