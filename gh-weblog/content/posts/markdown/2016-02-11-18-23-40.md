I made an [imgur image album](http://imgur.com/gallery/ObTlB) as an illustrated guide to making chocolate bread pudding - or at least, the kind I make these days (less death-by-chocolate, more tasty-not-too-sweet brownie alternative). If there's requests I'll turn that into a post on this blog, but the imgur link should be pretty stable so for now I'll leave it at that.
