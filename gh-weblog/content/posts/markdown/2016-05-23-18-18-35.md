I like [imgur.com](https://imgur.com), it's a great way to both fill moments of downtime with some interesting pictures posts, as well as waste too much time trying to find the next picture post, but one of the things that gets posted with reasonable frequency is food pictures, and they're always these high speed, "it's so easy just do this!" recipe gifs. 

While I won't contest that there are easy recipes, provided you do your prep first, cooking -and baking- takes time, and I wanted to create something that shows off *that* aspect of kitchen work.  So, I started a Youtube channel over on [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_vhEBO8O9ABn1f32KuUtjw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_vhEBO8O9ABn1f32KuUtjw), starting with a video series on [making baguette](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5_wrS2aqN9YFaSCWbpo-OEvbytigJWMY), start to finish. Baguette is not "easy", and it's not "fast"; any recipe that claims it is is either lying or selling you something (thanks "[The Princess Bride](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779)"!) but it is entirely doable, provided you follow all the steps, and all the steps take time. So I took mine and made 15 videos that document the process in real time, except for the "in the oven" videos, which are sped up because seeing what the dough does actually teaches you something.

And since it would be a shame to just do one kitchen video series and then sell the cameras I used again, I'll be trying to post some new series every now and then. For now, that means there's a video series for [Romano Pizza](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5_wrS2aqN9aPVEKij5gDLf91UoapIrWH) and a video series for [Chicken Shepherd's Pie](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5_wrS2aqN9Z7RYLc9-npfsMRH0hXUQut).

It's fun to do, obviously it's food that gets eaten after it gets made, and if you're tired of "an hour of work in 30 seconds" like I am, hit me up, I'm sure you have ideas I am interested in.
