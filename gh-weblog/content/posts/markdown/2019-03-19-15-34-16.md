I own a [Panasonic Lumix GH5](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dc-gh5), and it's pretty great, and I also own the [Panasonic Lumix Vario G 7-14mm aspherical lens](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-7-14-4-o20) and it's _also_ pretty great, except for one problem: you can't put filters on it. It has a ridiculous integrated sun hood without any sort of screwthread so you can't screw in even a clear filter to protect the lens, and I don't mean "from being dropped" but even from something simple like a bit of water spray hitting the lens glass and being a chore to clean off because the lens is a glass dome instead of an easy to clean sheet.

I had a look around at filter adapters and they're either [very expensive](https://www.amazon.com/Wonderpana-System-Olympus-7-14mm-Thirds/dp/B00AUK8XNG), or [simply non-existent](https://www.newsshooter.com/2014/05/05/dfocus-filter-adapter-for-panasonic-lumix-7-14-f4-0-designed-for-blackmagic-pocket-cinema-camera-users/), so I've been trying to figure out something that works without breaking the bank or custom fabrication. I initially thought of using the lens cap that comes with the lens, trimming off the "cap" side with a band saw, and then gluing a filter ring onto it so that I can screw in a filter, but as it turns out: you don't even need to do that.

The sun hood _just barely_ fits in a 72mm step up ring, fitting pretty tight, and while 72-82mm is not big enough of a step (you'll see the edges of the ring at 7mm), using a 72-86mm step ring works splendidly, without anything in the frame even at 7mm. So: rather than buying a $100+ solution so you can then mount unaffordable and hard to find 105mm filters to your lens, I would strongly recommend first trying the following $15 solution, instead (and if it doesn't work for you, at least you've only spent $15):

1. get a [72-86mm filter step-up ring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009T1C1IU)
2. get an [86mm thin UV filter](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07HJ98MCG)
3. you're done.

Well, almost: that sun hood isn't round, it's got some cutouts, so you probably want to put a strip of "something" to cover up those holes so light can't get in from behind, reflect off the rear of the filter glass, and make its way into your shot. It's artsy, but probably not what you're going for.

(You might be tempted to cut your lens cap for that, but I'd recommend against that: the cap works on the same principle of "wedging itself over the sun hood" so with the lens cap barrel over the sun hood, the lips of the sun hood will no longer have any spring, and can't grip the step-up ring)

Step 2: place your step-up ring 86mm down, 72mm up, and press your lens down all the way through.
