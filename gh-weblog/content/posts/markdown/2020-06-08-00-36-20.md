If you're reading this, you probably know my [Primer on BÃ©zier Curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/), but what you probably don't know is that until today this build process for this was entirely manual. A code change would require landing the code, then checking out `master`, running `npm run build`, then pushing the rebuilt files back up to `master`, and then doing the same for the `bezierinfo` repo, which exists in parallel.

Most of that work has now been automated with [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Whenever content or build related files get updated on the master branch, Github will now cause [ci.yml](https://github.com/Pomax/BezierInfo-2/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml) to kick in, which runs through the following steps:

1. check out `master`
2. Install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive), which installs all the TeX features that the primer relies on
3. Pulls the `pdf2svg` source code from the web and builds it
4. Grabs [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and uses it to install the latest version of Node and runs `npm install`
5. Runs `npm run build`, which runs [webpack several times](https://github.com/Pomax/BezierInfo-2/blob/master/webpack.config.js), once for each locale, which:
  - preprocesses the souce code to [replace LaTeX code with `<svg>` tags](https://github.com/Pomax/BezierInfo-2/blob/master/lib/latex-loader.js) by literally wrapping it in a LaTeX document and then calling [xelatex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) on that source,
  - crops the resulting PDF, then
  - converts that crop to an SVG image on disk, then
  - reads in the SVG image's dimensions so the original source can be replaced with `<img src="..." width="..." height="...">`, ensuring the document doesn't constantly reflow as images load in, then
  - wraps all example code such that references to the graphics API, which cannot possibly work in isolation, actually point to the right thing, and then finally,
   - runs the result through babel and bundles it up as `article.js` with its own `index.html` (because each locale needs an appropriate`lang=...`).
6. Commits and pushes the result back up to `master`

So the only thing I still need to do manually now is sync from the `BezierInfo-2` dev repo to the main `bezierinfo` repo, which feels sensible: you don't want to indiscriminately push your dev code to prod without review.

But this sure makes an involved process a heck of a lot easier.

I guess that means I should also add a Github action to automatically build the ToC for this blog site anytime I add a new entry... because that's also a manual step right now... and I can probably offload the RSS generation rather than doing that in-browser every time.
