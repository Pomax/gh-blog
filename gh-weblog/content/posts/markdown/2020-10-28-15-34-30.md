I needed to install Windows 7 on an old Shuttle computer, for which win10 would be too much of a constant load on the system (it's a completely passive system, and a constant 30% load on the cpu is very much not appreciated), and ran into an interesting problem. For the most part, installation is fine: get the official ISO from Microsoft on their [dedicated software download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows7), which requires supplying your windows 7 key (conveniently a sticker on the inside of the Shuttle case. Inconveniently, a sticker you can't remove and put in an organizer that has all your software keys).

Burn the ISO to a USB stick, which can thankfully be any old 4GB stick because windows 7, unlike 10, never grew past 3.5GB as base install (I use [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/), which can "burn" `.iso` files just fine, but you do need to file type filter for all file types, because it'll filter just for `.img` files), then boot off of said USB stick.

Once up and running, you start Windows Update (start → "all programs" → windows update) and then you go through the "install updates, reboot, install more updates, reboot, etc. etc." motions. Until you hit update `kb4516065`, which will fail with an error code 80092004 that has no article to explain what it means, and seemingly has no way to get past.

Thankfully, the advice in [this post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/kb4516065-installation-fails-with-error-80092004/ef9994ee-7820-436e-b18f-001ae53edf28) works: 

1. download and manually install [kb4490628](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/search.aspx?q=kb4490628)
2. then download and manually install [kb4516065](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=kb4516065)

Once done, windows update can get back to the "install updates, reboot, install more updates, reboot, etc" dance and all is well.

I mean, except for the part where you'll never receive security etc updates ever again, so once you're done installing everything, you _prooobably_ want to either air gap or network-restrict the machine so it can't reach, or be reached from, the internet. Which is exactly what I need (it just needs to accept audio feeds from a set of microphones that it can then forward on over LAN, no internet required) so happens to be fine for my use-case.
