There are a few ways to drag midi files into [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/), but the best way is also not documented:

1. Drag your .mid onto the program _background_, so **not** onto the channel rack, and **not** into a pattern, then
2. say "no" when asked to save the current project,
3. make sure "start new project" is unchecked in the MIDI import dialog, and then
4. hit accept: congrats, you're done.

Unlike the [officially documented way](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/automation_midiimport.htm), which splits up MIDI events into separate channels for no reason whatsoever, this method preserves the data and will import everything to the same channel if the .mid file had everything in the same channel. No need for the incredibly tedious "importing CC automation one CC at a time" workflow, just drag, drop, click, click, click, done: you now have a new channel rack entry that can play the midi data, and an associated pattern that you can place wherever you want in the arrangement window with all your midi data.
