Yours and everyone else's: there are two things you *need* to do.

1. Reset your mac's nvram, which is a hardware cache that includes SSD hardware information. If you don't reset it, macos is going to apply the old SSD's information to your new SSD, and you're going to have a bad time. Restart macos while holding `Command+Option+P+R` (all four keys at the same time) until you hear the mac chime. You won't _see_ anything, it'll just be a black screen, not an apple logo, so if you don't hear that chime: boot into macos regulary, make sure your audio's not muted, and retry.

2. Disable macos' drive standby, because your SSD is almost certainly incompatible with the apple hardware instructions. After booting into macos (after resetting the nvram) open a terminal and run:

```
$ sudo pmset -a standby 0 
```

You're done, your new (presumably much bigger) NVMe SSD will work just fine now,  and your mac will no longer crash at random
