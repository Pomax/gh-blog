Some folks love powershell. I am not one of those people: powershell breaks on standard command chaining using `&&`, making it decidedly useless for the work I do on the daily. Instead I use `cmd` for everything terminal-related. No "git bash", no "console2", just plain `cmd`.

And did you know that `cmd` has autorun functionality just like `bash` does? It doesn't use a `.bash_profile` (obviously) but it does let you specify what should run any time you start `cmd` by looking at two special registry keys mentioned in [the documentation for cmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd):

```
Cmd.exe looks for the following registry subkeys:

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun (REG_SZ)
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun (REG_EXPAND_SZ)
```

So, run `regedit` and find your way to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft`, create the `Command Processor` key if it doesn't exist (which it won't if you never used it before), and then create an expandable string value called `AutoRun` (paying attention to correct capitalization) and assign it the value `%USERPROFILE%\cmd-autorun.bat`, then create a file called `cmd-autorun.bat` in your own Windows user directory.

Done: you now have the equivalent of a `.bash_profile` for `cmd` that will run only for your user account (as it should be) any time you (or anything else) starts up `cmd`.
