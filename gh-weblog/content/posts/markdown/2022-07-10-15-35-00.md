React has had a fairly profound effect on the web, whether you like React or not, and whether you like the effect it had or not. However, the one thing it's done that's somewhat puzzling is make people think that React is its own thing, rather than just JS. Things that are trivial become colossal tasks and implementations because folks try to do them "in React". Anything that isn't DOM-update related needs a React solution, instead of using the JS APIs that are right there for you to use. So let's talk about a few.

## How do I tell component X about an update in component Y?

Imagine this: you wrote a React app that has a status and a whole bunch of different content, and you need to make sure your status bar reflects whatever is active right now. So you add a ref to your status bar, communicate that up to the parent `App`, which can then pass down a handler to every component until it makes it down into your components that can be active.

Or, you go "oh right, wait, I'm in a browser" and you just use events: your active component just fires-and-forgets a ```
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(`status:active`, { detail: ... }))
``` and your status bar registers a listener for that event when it mounts. We are done: nothing needs to run up and down an entire virtual DOM tree. And because this is basically just utility functionality, we write it as its own function that any component that needs to update the status bar can use, which we can import _from_ the Status bar:

```
// The only code that cares about this event name is the code
// in this file, so we capture it as a constant and nothing will
// ever need to care about what it is.
const STATUS_EVENT_NAME = `app:status:update`;

// yes, this is when you want a class, not a functional component
export class StatusBar extends React.Component {
  static getDefaultState() {
    return { statusMessage: `` };
  }
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = StatusBar.getDefaultState();
  }
  reset() {
    this.setState(StatusBar.getDefaultState());
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    document.addEventListener(STATUS_EVENT_NAME, evt => {
      const { statusMessage } = evt.detail;
      this.setState({ statusMessage });
    );
  }
  render() {
    return <footer className="">{ this.state.statusMessage }</footer>
  }
}

// And a nice function that other components with a status bar text can import and use:
export function updateStatusBar(msg) {
  const evt = new CustomEvent(STATUS_EVENT_NAME, { detail: msg });
  document.dispatchEvent(evt);
}
```

And look at that: no refs, no property forwards, or even crazier "sending the handler up to the parent once it's available" nonsense. You want some content to update the status bar? Just do that:

```
import { updateStatusBar } from "./StatusBar.js";

export const SomeContent = function(props) {
  useEffect(() => updateStatusBar(props.toolTip), props.toolTip);
  return <......>
}
```

Heck, this even works when there is no status bar component on the page. The events just get thrown away if there are no listeners for it, and everything works perfectly fine.

## How do I synchronize data across components?

Well, you could use Redux and learn a complex new technology, or you could just use JS, because anything running client-side is running within the same context, and imports are cached, so imports are shared by default. Want to see something that looks like it shouldn't be this simple?

```
export const dataPool = {};
```

Boom, done. Anything with `import { dataPool } from "datapool.js";` will now be sharing the same object. It's how JS works by design, we get this for free. And you can even get fancy without bolting on a data syncing framework until you absolutely need it:

```
const pool = {};
export const dataPool = {
  register: listener => listeners.push(listener);
  unregister: listener => {
    const pos = listeners.indexOf(listener);
    if (pos > -1) listeners.splice(pos, 1);
  },
  getValue: (name) => pool[name],
  setValue: (name, value) => {
    pool.name = value;
    for (let listener of listeners) listener.poolUpdated?(name, value);
  }
};
```

And now you have a synced data pool that uses a pub/sub model for data updates in less than 15 lines of code. 

### But this doesn't persist!

So save the data to `localStorage`, that's what it's for:

```
const dataKey = `app:dataPool`;
const pool = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(dataKey) ?? `{}`);

export const dataPool = {
  register: listener => listeners.push(listener);
  unregister: listener => {
    const pos = listeners.indexOf(listener);
    if (pos > -1) listeners.splice(pos, 1);
  },
  getValue: (name) => pool[name],
  setValue: (name, value) => {
    pool.name = value;
    localStorage.setItem(dataKey, JSON.stringify(pool));
    for (let listener of listeners) listener.poolUpdated?(name, value);
  }
};
```

Done. And now you have an excellent signal for when it's time to start thinking about more complex solutions, because `localStorage` has limited space available. If you're syncing more than a few MB across lots of components, it's probably time to rethink your app architecture.

## I want to close my modal component when someone clicks or taps outside of it

This one's close to my heart because I originally wrote react-onclickoutside almost a decade ago now because back in Ãže olden times JS was missing a _ton_ of features that modern JS has. Time has moved on, JS got updated a lot since, and so in modern JS we just.... don't need it anymore. Instead you can make this work with just a few lines of JS:

```
import { setupOutsideClickListener } from "./somewhere";

export const Menu = (props) => {
  const menuRef = useRef(null);

  // let's assume we're smart and have a const function for toggling
  // visibility of this component, used by whatever other logic needs
  // to control visibility
  const toggle = () => { ... }

  // set up the event listeners, using `[]` as dependency list so it only runs once.
  useEffect(() => setupOutsideClickListener(menuRef, toggle), []);

  return (
    <dialog ref={menuRef} ... >
      <span className="close-icon" onClick={toggle}>X</span>
        ...
    </dialog
  );
};
```

And here's our plain JavaScript:

```
export function setupOutsideClickListener(owner, toggle) {
  // always remember that if you have "click" handling, you better have a "touchstart", too!
  for (let type of [`click`, `touchstart`]) {
     document.addEventListener(type, ({ target }) => {
        // if this dialog is not on the page, or the events occur anywhere inside our dialog, we ignore the events.
        if (owner.current?.contains(target)) return;
        // if the dialog is on the page and the events are outside of it, toggle its visibility.
        toggle();
      });
    }
}
```

## And so much more

Unless you're already a seasoned programmer, you're almost certainly writing way too much code to do what you need, simply because you've been focusing on React too much, and not spending some time with plain JS to understand what this language that you're using can actually do. Once you've spent some time with React, the best thing you can do for yourself is putting React down, and reading up on modern JS on the web - what it can do, what syntax it uses for that, and how a lot of that can replace what you've used _a lot_ of code for with surprisingly little code.

Should you never use Redux? Or HoCs? Or anything else that's complex but full featured and everyone seems to be using? No of course not, but you should know _why_ you're using them, because they solve specific problems, and those are almost certainly not your problems. _Yet_
