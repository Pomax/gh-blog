Python does not have syntax for writing C structs, or things that act like them, but thankfully you can write a class decorator that adds something that feels like it should have been in the language from day one.

```
import copy


def struct(struct_class):
    # extract the struct members
    member_names = []
    member_values = []
    for attr_name in dir(struct_class):
        if not attr_name.startswith('_'):
            value = getattr(struct_class, attr_name)
            if not callable(value):
                member_names.append(attr_name)
                member_values.append(value)

    # create a new init
    def struct_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
        i = 0  # we really don't need enumerate() here...
        for value in args:
            name = member_names[i]
            default_value = member_values[i]
            setattr(self, name, value if value is not None else default_value)
            i += 1  # ...we just need to inc an int
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            if key in member_names:
                i = member_names.index(key)
                default_value = member_values[i]
                setattr(self, key, value if value is not None else default_value)
        # fall through  to the struct constructor.
        if hasattr(self.__class__, 'constructor'):
            self.constructor(**kwargs)

    # A struct can be iterated over, yielding and ordered list
    # based on member names defined in the struct class.
    def member_iter(self):
        return [copy.deepcopy(getattr(self, name)) for name in member_names].__iter__()

    # Structs do not allow shallow copying. All copies are a deep copies.
    def deep_copy(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

    # rebind and return
    struct_class.__init__ = struct_init
    struct_class.__iter__ = member_iter
    struct_class.__copy__ = deep_copy
    return struct_class
```

With this, we can write code with nice Struct-likes:

```
from as_struct import struct

@struct
class Orientation():
    pitch = 0
    roll = 0
    yaw = 0

@struct
class Trim():
    elevator = 0
    aileron = 0
    rudder = 0

class Brrrrrr():
    def __init__(self):
        self.description = "I'm a plane!"
        self.orientation = Orientation()
        self.trim = Trim()

    def trim(self, e=0, a=0, r=0):
        self.trim.elevator += e
        self.trim.aileron += a
        self.trim.rudder += r
```

Done.
