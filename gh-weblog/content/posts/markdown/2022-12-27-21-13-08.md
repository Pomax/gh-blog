If VMWare complains that it has insufficient rights to use a physical drive with adding a hard disk in the VM settings: open computer management with admin rights, then look for that drive in the list. If it has a drive letter: remove the drive letter. 

Remember: adding a physical drive means literally giving it to the guest OS, not "sharing it between the host and the guest", so remove its drive letter in computer management to _guarantee_ that your host's Windows can't use it. Once done, you can add it to your VM without any problems.

And if you need to _share_ drives, just use network sharing. That's what it's for.
