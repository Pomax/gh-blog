Have you ever needed a 3D cube LUT? Turns out, all you need is Photoshop! Whip out Photoshop and create a bunch of "adjustment layers" for your colour correction...

And then export that to a LUT using "export" -> "Color Lookup Tables..." with only "CUBE" as format and 32 points. Brilliant: instant 33 point 3d LUT for use in OBS, your video monitor,  in-camera, through a LUT box, etc. etc.!

But then you load it into OBS, or your LUT box, and oh no your video feed suddenly looks like this:

The problem you're seeing is almost certainly caused by having multiple image layers under your adjustment layer(s):

And the solution is to just flatten all of those, _then_ export your color adjustments as a cube LUT:

And presto, suddenly your LUT works just fine in OBS, or your LUT box, or any other context that needs a cube LUT:
