Ingredients:

- Jalapeno: x15~x20
- Habanero x6
- Tomatillo: x5 (small)
- Cilantro: 1 bunch (stems and all)
- Cumin: 3 tbsp
- Onion powder: 4 tbsp
- Black pepper: 1 tbsp
- Garlic paste: 5 tbsp
- Rock Salt: 35gr (1.5 tbsp)
- Thick apricot jam: 2.5 cups
- Apple cider vinegar: 1.5 cups
- Apple Juice: 0.5 cup
- Lemon juice:  4 tbsp
- Lime juice: 2 tbsp

Steps:

1. blend
2. keep blending.
3. keep it up!
4. yeah you're probably done.
