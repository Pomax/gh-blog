I released [socketless](https://github.com/pomax/socketless) v1.0.0 today, which is a websockets-based RPC library for Node-based client/server implementations, that removes all the websocket and RPC nonsense: you write normal JS code, your client and server see a `this.server` and `this.clients[...]` respectively, and if they need to call server and client functions respectively, they just... do that. Without ever knowing that the client or server is running on a completely different machine half the world away.

Obviously, this solves a problem for me: I hate writing websocket code, I just want to call functions and get return values, so maybe this is useful for you, too. 

I still need to set up a website for it (for now, the github repo will do), and I want to swap over my ["Are we flying?"](https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/) article and codebase to make use of this (as well as an unreleased multiplayer Mahjong implementation, more on that in the future, hopefully), which I'm sure will reveal things I still need to add or change, but for now, this is incredibly useful as is, and if you've ever wanted to write a client/server "anything", be it a game, chat server, BBS, whathaveyou, this should make that jobs a ridiculous amount easier.
