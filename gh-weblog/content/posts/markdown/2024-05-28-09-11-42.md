Ever run into a Lightroom showing you this?

![initial stuck image view](/images/stuck-image/initial-view.jpg)

Lightroom shows you an image in your grid and strip views, but it's also super obvious there isn't actually an image file backing it. No filename, no metadata, just nothing. And you can't remove it: LR just ignores your delete button, and your context-menu-initiated "remove photo", and when you tell LR to optimize your catalog in the hopes of clearing this up, it's still there.

When this happens, the quickest solution is to fix your light room catalog by _not using lightroom_ and instead using one of the most used tools in the industry: Sqlite3. Sqlite is a file-based database management system, where a single file is a single data, which makes it ideal as a file format for applications, and you'll find it everywhere. Including lightroom. In fact...

## .lrcat files are literally just Sqlite3 databases

You can tell any tool that lets you work with Sqlite databases to load your .lrcat file, and it will just do that for you. And because it's just a database, you can query it: say you wanted the filename list of all your photos that you haven't tagged yet. You can ask Lightroom to do this, but it'll take _forever_ if you have a large catalog. Or you can query the lrcat database directly and get the answer in a few milliseconds:

```sqlite
SELECT
  originalFilename as filename
FROM
  Adobe_images as imageRecord,
  AgLibraryFile as file
WHERE
  imageRecord.rootFile = file.id_local
AND
  imageRecord.id_local NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT(image) FROM AgLibraryKeywordImage
  )
```

And that speed is not hyperbole: directly using Sqlite means you're bypassing everything except the thing you're interested in, and so it can run _really_ fast compared to running an operation in Lightroom.

## Finding our bad image

There's a surprisingly simple way to find our bad image:

1. With Lightroom closed, copy our lrcat file to a new file called `a.db`.
2. Open Lightroom, and change one thing about the bad image, like flagging it, or adding it to the quick collection.
3. Close lightroom, then copy our updated lrcat file to a new file called `b.db`.

Then, take advantage of [sqldiff](https://www.sqlite.org/sqldiff.html), which is a tool that comes with sqlite3 that lets you compare two databases in a normal, human readable way.

## Adding our image to the quick collection

Let's look at what happens when we use the quick collection as our method of "finding out what changed":

```sqlite
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value=1696396.0 WHERE id_local=1;
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value='5EE3773B-1CC4-400B-8886-336773BA06DB' WHERE id_local=7;
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value='volumeInfo = {'||X'0a09'
||'["D:\\"] = {'||X'0a0909'
||'expanded = true,'||X'0a0909'
||'freeSpace = 12345678,'||X'0a0909'
||'name = "Some Drive (C:)",'||X'0a0909'
||'offline = false,'||X'0a0909'
||'size = 12345678,'||X'0a09'
||'},'||X'0a'
||'}'||X'0a' WHERE id_local=54;
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value='s = {'||X'0a09'
||'{'||X'0a0909'
||'type = "collection",'||X'0a0909'
||'value = {'||X'0a090909'
||'collectionId = 441740,'||X'0a090909'
||'creationId = "com.adobe.ag.library.smart_collection",'||X'0a090909'
||'tableName = "AgLibraryCollection",'||X'0a0909'
||'},'||X'0a09'
||'},'||X'0a'
||'}'||X'0a' WHERE id_local=55;
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value='C16EE445-1362-4410-9996-617C7092D74A' WHERE id_local=121;
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value=738175364.159989 WHERE id_local=131;
UPDATE AgDNGProxyInfo SET statusDateTime='2024-05-23 16:41:17' WHERE id_local=1688612;
UPDATE AgDNGProxyInfo SET statusDateTime='2024-05-23 16:41:17' WHERE id_local=1688616;
[...a whole lot more of these statusDateTime update...]
UPDATE AgDNGProxyInfo SET statusDateTime='2024-05-23 16:41:17' WHERE id_local=1689090;
UPDATE AgDNGProxyInfo SET statusDateTime='2024-05-23 16:41:17' WHERE id_local=1689092;
DELETE FROM AgLibraryCollectionImage WHERE id_local=1681399;
INSERT INTO AgLibraryCollectionImage(id_local,collection,image,pick,positionInCollection) VALUES(1696395,5,1672248,0.0,NULL);
INSERT INTO AgLibraryCollectionImageChangeCounter(rowid,collectionImage,collection,image,changeCounter) VALUES(1,1696395,5,1672248,132891);
DELETE FROM AgLibraryCollectionImageChangeCounter WHERE rowid=2;
DELETE FROM AgSpecialSourceContent WHERE id_local=1665;
INSERT INTO AgSpecialSourceContent(id_local,content,owningModule,source) VALUES(1667,NULL,'com.adobe.ag.library.filter','entire_library');
UPDATE LrMobileSyncChangeCounter SET changeCounter=132891 WHERE rowid=1;
```

That's a lot of stuff, but it's the `AgLibraryCollectionImageChangeCounter` bit we care about, because we only changed a single thing for a single image. If we add some white space to make things a little more obvious, we see:

```sqlite
INSERT INTO AgLibraryCollectionImageChangeCounter
  (   rowid  ,  collectionImage  ,  collection  ,   image  ,  changeCounter  )
VALUES
  (     1    ,       1696395     ,       5      ,  1672248  ,    132891      );
```

This tells us that there was a change to the image with its own numerical identifier `1672248`, stored in the "collection list" with identifier `1696395`, in a collection with identifier `5`. So let's quickly make sure this is, indeed, the quick collection using (in this case, but you have plenty of options) [db browser for sqlite]()

![a quick check...](/images/stuck-image/quick-check.jpg)

Collection 5 is indeed the quick collection: perfect, we can now confidently say that our offending image has `1672248` as its identifier.

## Removing the offender from the catalog

So, let's look up our image: the lrcat database stores this information in the `Adobe_images` table, so if we look up the record with `id_local=1672248` we get:

```
id_local: 1672248
id_global: 42A3E56C-D027-4E71-AFF3-6A1907189580
aspectRatioCache: 0.654052734375

colorLabels:
colorMode: 2.0
copyCreationTime: -63113817600.0
copyName:
copyReason:
developSettingsIDCache: 1675643.0
fileFormat: JPG
fileHeight: 4096.0
fileWidth: 2679.0
hasMissingSidecars:

pick: 0.0
positionInFolder: z
propertiesCache: 1675639.0
pyramidIDCache: none
rating:
rootFile: 1675632
sidecarStatus: 0.0
touchCount: 1.0
touchTime: 731557537.900445
```

That's a bunch of stuff! But really what we want to do is delete this image, so most of these values don't matter, and we really only care about these four:

```
id_local: 1672248
developSettingsIDCache: 1675643.0
propertiesCache: 1675639.0
rootFile: 1675632
```

- The first is the image's identifier in the image table.
- The second is the identifier for the associated record in the `Adobe_imageDevelopSettings` table
- The third is the identifier for the associated record in the `Adobe_imageProperties` table
- The last is the identifier for the associated record in the `AgLibraryFile` table, and _that_ is where the problem will be: this table houses all the information of which real, on-disk files, map to virtual, in-database image records.

And wouldn't you know it: if we check the `AgLibraryFile` table and try to find the record with `id_local=1675632`,  there isn't one.

## Fixing this database

<details>
<summary>
In order to find out all the places that we'll need to update we can dump our catalog as a SQL file, and then search through it with any decent text editor. When we do, we find that there are 19 places where we may need to intervene.

```

</details>

That's a lot of text! But also: only 19 places where we need to delete a record, and we can do that pretty efficiently with SQL.

### Updating `Adobe_variablesTable`

We're going to set both the `Adobe_selectedImages` and `Adobe_activeImage` fields that currently point to our non-existent image to empty. Depending on the DB manager you're using this could be a simple matter of directly editing the field, but you can also do this using SQL (obviously):

```javascript
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value = '' WHERE name = 'Adobe_selectedImages';
UPDATE Adobe_variablesTable SET value = '' WHERE name = 'Adobe_activeImage';
```

### Deleting all references to our non-existent image

All that's left now is to remove references to our image from the various tables. Again, we can either do this manually, or we can use some SQL:

```javascript
DELETE FROM Adobe_AdditionalMetadata WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgMetadataSearchIndex WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM Adobe_imageProperties WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM Adobe_libraryImageDevelopHistoryStep WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM Adobe_images WHERE id_local = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgDevelopAdditionalMetadata WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgLibraryCollectionImage WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgLibraryIPTC WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgLibraryImportImage WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgSourceColorProfileConstants WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM Adobe_imageDevelopSettings WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgHarvestedExifMetadata WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgHarvestedIptcMetadata WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgHarvestedDNGMetadata WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgLibraryImageChangeCounter WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgLibraryImageSyncedAssetData WHERE image = 1672248;
DELETE FROM AgLibraryCollectionImageChangeCounter WHERE image = 1672248;
```

Note that we're dealing with the identifier from the `Adobe_images` so we're deleting from that table using `id_local` whereas we're deleting from every other table using `image`.

## How did we do?

If we now open Lightroom on our updated catalog, what do we see?

![the result](/images/stuck-image/the-result.png)

And that's our problem solved. No more phantom image. It's a good idea to run a (hopefully) quick catalog optimization, but other than that, it's back to not having to deal with this problem hopefully forever!
