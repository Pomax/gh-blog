The DS1819+ is an 8 bay NAS with a PCIe slot, and one of the things you can use that for is to drop in a PCIe 2.5 GBe NIC in order to make your life a lot easier. When you do, you can either use Synology's insanely overpriced own solution, or you can just buy a TP-Link TX201, which is a cheap 2.5GB network card based on the Realtek 8125 chip. 

The downside is that the NAS does not come with a full linux distro, so it doesn't have drivers for that chip, but the upside is that getting that driver is a github away: head over to https://github.com/tabrezm/r8125-synology and follow the instructions.

However, those instructions might leave you with a solution that requires loading the driver again and again, every time your NAS restarts, which is rather inconvenient, and so my solution for that was to just add a bit to the `rc.d` file that does this for us:

```
#!/bin/sh

case $1 in
    start)
        echo "Loading realtek 8125 module"
        insmod /lib/modules/r8125.ko
        ip link set up eth4
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "Unloading realtek 8125 module"
        rmmod r8125
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

exit 0
```

And done. Rebooting the NAS will now load the driver we need and we can enjoy glorious 2.5 GBe connectivity.
