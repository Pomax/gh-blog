Did you know that there isn't just a dumb, simple Windows utility for turning a joystick or game controller into a MIDI device? Sure. you can find 15 year old utilities (that have no docs, so good luck figuring out why they don't work even if they _run_), and yes, you can find some dedicated "profile" utils that map specific game controller buttons to specific MIDI outs, but like... I have [VKB-Sim rudder pedals](https://www.vkbcontrollers.com/products/t-rudders-mk-v-rudder-pedals) because [I might like flight sim a little too much](https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/) and not a minute goes by while I'm sitting at my desk that my feet don't think they're resting on sostenuto and sustain pedals. Because there's also a keyboard sitting on my desk. 

So can I please just get something that actually turns them into that when I need them to?

I have, it has no documentation, and all the buttons are greyed out. Not a fan.

> "Have you tried [mJoy](http://www.otk.it/mjoy/)??"

I have. Have you? In 2024? Because if you have you wouldn't recommend it.

I like Ableton, but I dont want a specif-

Look, I own something like ten DAWs ([Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/), [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/), [Cubase](https://www.steinberg.net/cubase/), [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com), [Serrato](https://serato.com/), [Studio One](https://www.presonus.com/en/studio-one.html), [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), [Reason](https://www.reasonstudios.com/), [ReNoise](https://www.renoise.com/), [Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-pro)) plus a bunch of esoteric or now-dead ones like [Flip](https://www.flipsampler.com/) or [SunVox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) or [SonarX3](https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/cakewalk-sonar-x3-producer) or [ZRhythm](https://www.zrythm.org/en/index.html) (I know, the last one's free. I signed up to their nightly subscription because I think that effort _absolutely_ deserves funding) and "I stopped counting" however many standalone VSTi. You think I'm going to configure each of them separately? Because I'm definitely not.

> "Well what about [joy2midi](https://github.com/jessecrossen/hautmidi/tree/master/joy2midi)?"

A JACK-only linux suggestion? I like where your head's at, except I'm on Windows so that's not going to help us much here.

Actually, after a bit of digging... yeah? I can write a universal solution that'll work for anything that can deal with more than one MIDI device (which is all commercial software and nearly-all freeware) in 25 lines of code, if I'm willing to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and a virtual midi device manager like [LoopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html), a utility that I already use anyway. 

Step 1: Let me create a virtual MIDI device in LoopMIDI called "Rudder Sustain" for this. Inspired name, I know: I'm a programmer, we're fantastic at naming things.

Step 2: Install the Node libraries for working with USB devices and MIDI: `npm install node-hid easymidi`.

Step 3: Write a near-trivial `pedals.js` file:

```
import HID from "node-hid";
import easymidi from "easymidi";
const { abs, round } = Math;

// Get our virtual MIDI device
const out = new easymidi.Output("Rudder Sustain", process.platform !== "win32");

// Get our VKB-sim rudder
const device = await HID.HIDAsync.open(8989, 287);

// And start mapping data!
const MIDPOINT = 1024;
const scale = 127 / MIDPOINT;
let value, previous;
device.on("data", (bytes) => {
  const v = bytes[13] + bytes[14] * 256;
  if (v !== previous) {
    previous = v;
    value = round(abs((v - 1024) * scale));
    if (v <= MIDPOINT) out.send("cc", { channel: 1, controller: 66, value });
    if (v >= MIDPOINT) out.send("cc", { channel: 1, controller: 64, value });
  }
});

console.log(`\nSustain mapper running. Press ctrl-c to exit.\n\n`);
```

Let me unpack that script a little:

1. First we get a reference to the virtual MIDI device that we created using loopMIDI by the venerable Tobias Erichsen. The platform check is a bit silly, but the easymidi library itself doesn't perform Windows detection, so it wants "true" for linuxy systems and something falsey for Windows.
1. Then we get a reference to the "Human Input Device" that my rudder pedals are registered as. USB is kind of bizarre in that every. single. USB. device. has to have its own vendor ID and product ID, and those **must** be registered with the USB consortium. I'm pretty sure that's a racket, but I can't prove it, so we'll leave it at that. VKB Sim's vendor id is 8989 and the product id is 287, and I only have one so it's a straight "get the only instance of this device" call.
1. Then we map the left and right pedals to [sostenuto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_pedals#Sostenuto_pedal) ("only hold the notes that are currently down") and [sustain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustain_pedal) ("don't dampen any note") respectively: the rudder pedals generate values from 0 (left pedal down) to 2047 (right pedal down) with the neutral position generating 1024. so we just can fairly trivially map both ranges to the MIDI value range 0 through 127.
1. We then send the mapped value with either controller code 66 for sostenuto or controller code 64 for sustain (or both, if the pedals return to neutral), on MIDI channel 1. With a small bit of overhead to make sure we don't send duplicate values.

And... uh... that's it?  We can just run this with `node pedals` and done: as long as we enable the "Rudder Sustain" MIDI input  in whatever DAW or standalone instrument we're using, those flight sim pedals are now MIDI pedals. 

In 25 lines of code including comments and console logs.

Programming is a superpower.
