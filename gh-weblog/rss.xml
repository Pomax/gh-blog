<description># Authentication
There's an authentication "link" at the top (it currently looks like a dotted circle) that you can click and then input your github application token. These tokens are tied to your own repo, so while you'll see the "admin" buttons if you authenticate with a wrong key, the actual updates to github will get rejected.

# Rebuilding the gh-page site
Another interesting thing is that because gh-pages don't instantly rebuild, you can't immediately link someone to the page after you posted an entry. Think of it as a cool-down period (or a bug. Either works, but a cool-down period is nicer).

# Manual updates
It's just a code repo, so you can do as much manual work as you like by just doing a **git pull**, editing/removing/whathaveyou to your heart's content, and then pushing that up to the gh-pages branch. It's just code.

# Okay, so who are you?
I'm Pomax. I work for Mozilla on [webmaker](https://webmaker.org), and dabble on the side (I wrote a fairly lengthy article on [Bezier curve math](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo) a while back, and did some [font work](http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/Font.js) that you may or may not have heard of). You can reach me on IRC as "Pomax" on irc.mozilla.org, or about 10 other servers I idle on, as well as on github. Or if you prefer social media, you can find me in the tweeterspace as [@TheRealPomax](https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax).</description>

<description>#Where do I get the code?
Head over to [https://github.com/Pomax/gh-blog](https://github.com/Pomax/gh-blog) and grab the code to play with.

#And where are the readme/instructions?
Same place as the code; head over to the repo for the extended details on how to use this blog setup.</description>

<description>#So what's all this then?

This is a web log that's running through github's "you make a branch called gh-pages and we'll host it on yourname.github.io/reponame" concept. Each entry is just a code commit (a .json file, to be exact), and is loaded from github into this page. Since entries are just code, when you write a new entry, or edit an existing entry, or delete an entry you no longer want to be public, this page uses the JavaScript GitHub API to simply effect those changes in your github repo. It's like gh-pages inside gh-pages. Sort of.

Anyway, the point is that you don't need anything other than github to make this work. No LAMP stack, or CMS install, just a github account and a gh-pages branch. Done. Weirdly enough, this did not exist yet... and I has some spare time so I wrote it myself.

Authoring uses Github flavoured Markdown syntax (see [the synax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) for the details on that), so posting new entries is really easy, and follows the syntax you are probably already familiar with from your README.md files. If you're not familiar with Markdown: it's basically magic and plain text gets converted to decent looking marked up text. Because you really shouldnt need to know HTML for write some blog entries. Or need TinyMCE.</description>
